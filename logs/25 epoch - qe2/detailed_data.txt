1251 T= of course designers don &apos;t only look at the top@@ ic of per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral processes or cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , but pri@@ mar@@ ily at the top@@ ic of the relationship between man and object of course .

1293 0.22402 H= this model will already be already developed in na@@ van and is internet cultural cultural , so it works glob@@ ally at young and age , and will it be used by us all the time , without that the most important thing is that this model is present .
1296 T= and this kind of trans@@ fer@@ al , much like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action .

1296 0.31553 H= so , through this kind of over@@ negoti@@ ation , similar like dealing with the metaphor of des@@ k@@ top now , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of mobile wea@@ pon , one hand@@ board lea@@ p lea@@ p .
1916 T= i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the person behind pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a that he re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t@@ ated that word again , because after the wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing was bad .

1171 T= against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps for@@ gotten , and what is instin@@ ctive for us , so what difference does it make ?

1171 0.08936 H= before what i &apos;ve also been thinking about what does it mean because what is it because actually , what haven &apos;t we have , what have perhaps been , what have we also instin@@ c@@ tively , but what does makes the difference ?
3590 T= and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h-@@ and-@@ bone legs , i wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .

3058 T= but if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a letter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .

3058 0.0 H= but as you like the shape , in which you can change this , for example , transform in a smaller ball ball , and these blue fla@@ kes , and a boo@@ sty characters on this , she &apos;s actually dete@@ able effec@@ ti@@ ver .
3123 T= i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-@@ being is .
3123 0.26106 G= i think there <b>&apos;s</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> meaning <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>con@@</b> <b>tain</b> it , but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> big and <b>all</b> <b>this</b> is something <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> give up <b>,</b> and we <b>&apos;re</b> <b>going</b> to have to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>&apos;re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>well-@@</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> <b>.</b>

2985 T= it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pro@@ sp@@ ering .

1133 T= i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curi@@ osity and how curi@@ osity in turn trans@@ forms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curi@@ osity and need to give it a j@@ ol@@ t et ce@@ ter@@ a .

1174 T= and to see when something is intui@@ tive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friend@@ ly , so as intui@@ tive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .

3527 T= so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt is our greatest as@@ set .

2584 T= so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
2584 0.18943 G= so <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>big</b> <b>pri@@</b> <b>ces</b> here <b>.</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>in</b> <b>trans@@</b> <b>mission</b> , <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>,</b> <b>you</b> <b>don</b> <b>&apos;t</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>,</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> .
