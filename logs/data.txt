2380 G= something interesting happened at ab@@ y@@ ss : &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; : to solve a narra@@ tive problem in this film -- and that &apos;s what we had a kind of liquid water cre@@ ature -- c@@ g , back .
453 T= here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using ye@@ ast mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast puts them together auto@@ matically .
453 H= this is a recor@@ ded recor@@ ding of which molecule we &apos;ve produced by using these processes -- indeed , only le@@ f@@ -@@ mechan@@ ics using the actual design of pieces of pieces have fit them adap@@ ting them auto@@ matically . le@@ ast these auto@@ matically add auto@@ matically .
453 G= so here &apos;s a complete shot of the molecule that we &apos;ve used by using these kinds of processes -- in fact , we used only using he@@ fe@@ -@@ mechan@@ ism with the right design of the pieces , and ac@@ qui@@ re feet that auto@@ matically combin@@ ed auto@@ matically .
1148 T= that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same ca@@ ve or another place together , build cities and villa@@ ges and basically created this tri@@ b@@ al society .
1148 H= that means , you &apos;ve found himself that people spoke together , you could communicate another language , you could communicate together , is dra@@ wn in other regi@@ ons , or villa@@ ges and has cir@@ cul@@ ed , or villa@@ ges and created as born stem society .
1148 G= that means you &apos;ve found a shared language , which has spo@@ ken a shared language , could be communic@@ ated with each other , or in other areas , cities form ge@@ formed or villa@@ ges , has created the tri@@ b@@ al society .
2063 T= and na@@ than@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ it@@ ation when we started our first lesson at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
2063 H= and in exactly as a traffic stage , na@@ than@@ e , as we started talking about our ini@@ tial sub@@ lec@@ tures hour in law@@ ney dis@@ ney -- he had lost this ir@@ re river in his eyes and effective completely lost in his eye and effective completely lost .
2063 G= and in exactly as a ri@@ z@@ sta@@ dium found na@@ than@@ iel , when we started with our first under@@ gui@@ dance hour in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney . he had this ir@@ re fl@@ ack@@ ers in his eyes and completely lost completely lost .
444 T= when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ adi@@ ly in e@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .
444 H= now , if we go to these kinds of big pieces -- over 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- they won &apos;t become just right ; col@@ i grow . it &apos;s increasing all the ways of modern molecular biology biology , and so we changed other mechanis@@ ms .
444 G= if we get to this right great st@@ ap@@ s -- with about 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- they &apos;re not going to grow up in e@@ . col@@ i . and so all of the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we conver@@ ted to other mechanis@@ ms .
3587 T= and dr. ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; in my experience , unless repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told otherwise , and even if given a modi@@ c@@ um of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
3587 H= and he says , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that , &quot; i learned kids who don &apos;t get told something else , and also when they only get a little bit better when you only get a little bit more support when you allow kids to reach themselves , kids can reach very much . &quot;
3587 G= and dr. ke@@ an told on , he said , &quot; i learned that children , if they &apos;re not always given something else , and even if you get only a bit of support , if you can &apos;t get children much much . &quot;
2498 T= the coal revolution fu@@ el@@ ed the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very ra@@ pid dec@@ line in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
2498 H= evolution evolution oper@@ ated industrial revolution in industrial revolution and himself in 20 century , there had been a ra@@ pid case in the electric capit@@ ality , and that &apos;s why we fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed fri@@ ctions , and so many things we can do modern materials and doing so many things .
2498 G= the co@@ hl@@ er@@ evolution drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there were a quick case in the electricity range , and that &apos;s why we have cool@@ ed , climate change , we can make modern materials and so many things .
3057 T= it turns out that if you ad@@ minister a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like as@@ pir@@ in sha@@ ped -- it &apos;s just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
3057 H= and it turns out , because if you provide an plac@@ e@@ bo in form of a ball pilot in form of a pir@@ in@@ et spre@@ ad , which is just a round p@@ ill that has a specific effect that has created a specific measu@@ re@@ ments that have created a specific meas@@ able effect .
3057 G= and it turns out , if you offer a plac@@ e@@ bo in a form of a white f@@ le in the form of an as@@ pi@@ in@@ tab@@ in@@ tab@@ le@@ tte , it &apos;s just a round , white mush@@ rooms , which has a particular measu@@ re@@ ment effect .
3571 T= a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ astern pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing over a bus@@ he@@ l of to@@ ma@@ to@@ es .
3571 H= in front of a few years ago , in the city i grew up living into a food center in the middle of the world in the most mal@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i stood there in front of a switch dead to@@ ma@@ ma ago .
3571 G= a few years , i went to the town , in which i grew up in the city , in a living middle market in that &quot; red zone &quot; in the nor@@ the@@ ast of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing there in a s@@ halt el to@@ ma@@ tes .
6653 T= so those are the three main attac@@ kers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , ha@@ ck@@ tivi@@ sts like anony@@ mous doing it for the pro@@ test , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attac@@ ks .
6653 H= so these are three main gri@@ t@@ group : crimin@@ als doing doing the money that it &apos;s money for doing sharks most like how anony@@ ologists afford services who are able to support govern@@ ance , but the lat@@ est group are nations who gui@@ de attack the attac@@ ks .
6653 G= so these are the three primary flu groups : crimin@@ als , which are the money of the yellow , ha@@ ck@@ tiv@@ sts like anony@@ mous , but the last group are nations , but the last group are nations , governments , governments who gover@@ n attac@@ ks .
4044 T= years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate ad@@ vis@@ ers who knew i was interested in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i considered myself a fe@@ min@@ ist , as i still do -- asked a really strange question .
4044 H= before years ago , as i graduate graduate school asked me a graduate student who asked me a graduate students who knew my interest on soli@@ ism kan@@ cro@@ called -- i used to be a fe@@ min@@ ist , doing so still -- a really curious question . a really curious question . a really curious question .
4044 G= years years , when i studied a college , i asked one of my graduate students , who knew my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i looked at a fe@@ min@@ ism -- i looked at a fe@@ min@@ ist -- i looked at a fe@@ min@@ ist , as a fe@@ min@@ ist question .
4108 T= i don &apos;t need to get emotion@@ ally atta@@ ched to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , color@@ ful , sh@@ in@@ y out@@ fit just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
4108 H= and i have to not have these kinds of stuff not necessarily about the corner will always be some other weird , color@@ ful , color@@ ful of out@@ fit that only on me when i have love a little love in he@@ arts and search .
4108 G= i must ha@@ cked this things not emotion@@ ally ha@@ cked , because the right to the corner is always a different crazy , color@@ named fro@@ g , stra@@ ve of the out@@ fit , that &apos;s just waiting for the heart , and it &apos;s looking for .
3043 T= in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my inde@@ x finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position poin@@ ting out like this .
3043 H= because right now , where i know my hand from you away from you so you see from behind you , moves this finger here , finger finger finger , just from where he was where he had stre@@ t@@ ched so exten@@ ded .
3043 G= in the moment , where i turn my hand out of them , so it moves you from the back , this fing@@ ers here , my line fing@@ ers , simple of there , where he was , in a position where it was , in a position where it &apos;s been stre@@ t@@ ched out .
3596 T= if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so re@@ cep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ cial moment , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
3596 H= now , if you allow somebody to activ@@ ate your own , intern@@ al power -- human spirit is so com@@ pris@@ ing ready -- when they create that , and for somebody open a door , they &apos;re open for these people a very good teachers .
3596 G= if you allow someone to activ@@ ate your own , intern@@ al forces -- the human spirit is so em@@ pi@@ re -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you open up a door , you open up a door , you open for those people , a very good teacher .
3812 T= in both my vo@@ cation at ro@@ bin hood and my avo@@ cation as a volunte@@ er fire@@ fi@@ ghter , i am wit@@ ness to acts of gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness on a mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al scale , but i &apos;m also wit@@ ness to acts of gra@@ ce and coura@@ ge on an individual basis .
3812 H= both in my prof@@ f at rob@@ am hood as also in my side prof@@ ession as a fire@@ figh@@ ter fire@@ figh@@ ters , i am planes from gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness of kin@@ dness and friend@@ ern@@ ess of the next love and patterns of the nan@@ ny love and patterns of patterns and patterns of patterns from individuals .
3812 G= both in my prof@@ ession at ro@@ bin hood as a volunte@@ er as a volunte@@ er fire@@ man , i &apos;m wit@@ ness of gener@@ osity and friend@@ iness in the great scale , but i also see the next ast@@ ist love and mu@@ ts of the next ast@@ ist love and the mu@@ ts of individuals .
4033 T= but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-@@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very b@@ ad@@ ly , and so he had to do this .
4033 H= but when i did him , and he wonder@@ ed , why he asked this interven@@ tion -- it was highly cra@@ cra@@ cra@@ cy sur@@ ger@@ ies -- his response that children would become become become treated , and that &apos;s why he needed to become very treated , and therefore he needed to do it .
4033 G= but when i one@@ ered him with him , and he asked why he made this one-@@ flu -- it was up to ris@@ ky operating operating -- his answer , that in his country , that children would be treated very poor , and so he had to do it .
2572 T= it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly reg@@ ul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
2572 H= it also has three major issues too : the cost , mostly in high-@@ reg@@ ul@@ ated countries are high , asking security , that you really feel that nothing can walk , despite the human participa@@ tion that the fuel becomes not used for weapons .
2572 G= it has three great problems . the cost , especially in high-@@ regu@@ lations countries are high . the question after security , that you really feel really felt that nothing can go wrong , despite the human contribu@@ tion that the green@@ fabri@@ c is not used for weapons .
2561 T= we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ belie@@ vable scale and un@@ belie@@ vable reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many direc@@ tions people are see@@ king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
2561 H= and we need solutions that either one or several multiple sc@@ aling an uni@@ mag@@ able sc@@ aling sc@@ ales and uni@@ mag@@ able dis@@ ability , and although many direc@@ tions where people look after , i really only look five those who can afford these large dem@@ ands can afford these large dem@@ ands can afford these large dem@@ ands .
2561 G= we need solutions , either one or several of the one un@@ belie@@ vable sk@@ ali@@ dation and un@@ conc@@ able ver@@ s@@ ability , and even though there are many direc@@ tions , in which people are looking for , i really only see five , which can afford these great dem@@ ands .
4751 T= the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distin@@ ct , but comple@@ ment@@ ary sides to your brand person@@ ality -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is a min@@ d@@ ful / play brand .
4751 H= the first thing i saw , this idea was that their brand of arti@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ i two comm@@ separ@@ ated sites -- mur@@ der cre@@ cre@@ te brand brand brand / eight / / / brand brand brand brand brand .
4751 G= the first one that i saw was this idea that their mar@@ ken@@ person@@ es of light e@@ ct@@ i &apos;s two , but it &apos;s the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lo@@ cally mar@@ ke .
4773 T= they en@@ ab@@ led us to tell the story about neuro@@ marketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mr@@ i &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commer@@ ci@@ als as well as movie marketing .
4773 H= they used us telling telling history about neuro@@ marketing , telling telling history about how we tell history in this movie is telling that today is uses mr@@ i to use the air centers of the brain , both to make adverti@@ sing adverti@@ sing both adverti@@ sing adverti@@ sing adverti@@ sing as also movies .
4773 G= they en@@ able us to tell the story of the neuro@@ marketing , so how we used to tell the story in this film , that today is using mr@@ is , to p@@ ei@@ ling , both to make adverti@@ sing films as movies .
5088 T= now choo@@ sing not to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ i@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affec@@ ts us even in very consequ@@ enti@@ al decisions .
5088 H= now not buying not buying a glass mel@@ ket is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for us -- it &apos;s good for our tac@@ sil@@ ence -- but it turns out that decisi@@ on-@@ process@@ ing process also influ@@ enced ourselves in very const@@ ite decisions .
5088 G= well , no glass mar@@ mel@@ ade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our ta@@ ille -- but it turns out that the decision of over@@ la@@ st@@ process problems .
6375 T= and i came out of medical school with the impres@@ sion that if i memor@@ i@@ zed everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would imm@@ uni@@ ze me against making mista@@ kes .
6375 H= and let me consu@@ me the medical school studying the notion i , if i knew everything that i knew if i knew everything all knew , or at least as possible as possible as possible that i was im@@ imm@@ n against the make of mista@@ kes .
6375 G= and i left the medical school , with the impres@@ sion that i knew if i knew everything , or at least as much as possible as possible , as close as possible , as close as possible , that i could im@@ mu@@ n against mista@@ kes .
2985 T= it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pro@@ sp@@ ering .
2985 H= it &apos;s a process , sometimes it sometimes doesn &apos;t work and sometimes he doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science shouldn &apos;t allow us to do their work because we fear is really a really g@@ gling gas , and they stop millions from humans from blo@@ blo@@ wing off .
2985 G= it &apos;s a process , and sometimes sometimes it works and sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science , because we &apos;re sc@@ ared of a real s@@ ack@@ gas@@ sis , and it takes millions of people from the rise .
127 T= this is a photograph i took at the northern ti@@ p of ba@@ ff@@ in island when i went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some in@@ u@@ it people , and this man , ol@@ a@@ y@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
127 H= this is one photograph i took on the nor@@ th@@ res@@ th@@ end of the ba@@ ff@@ in-@@ in-@@ the-@@ end ran@@ king in the sc@@ wh@@ wh@@ ale al-@@ ju@@ g@@ d , and this guy , ol@@ a@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
127 G= this is a photograph that i recor@@ ded at the ne@@ ord@@ able end of the ba@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands when i went with in@@ u@@ its on the nar@@ wh@@ al ja@@ g@@ d , and this man , ol@@ a@@ ya told a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
1189 T= we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a conf@@ using way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &apos;t tell which one is s@@ alt and which one is pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can basically design them intui@@ tively , by showing things .
1189 H= what we see here , when i shape things old , i can design you how on ri@@ ght-@@ hand side side side , where i don &apos;t know what is alt and p@@ ill , or i can design them sort of intui@@ tive by showing things like i can show you sort of intui@@ tive by showing things like i &apos;m going to show you how things like on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what is alt and p@@ ill , or i can show you , like , when i see things old , when i look things like things like on the right side , where i can shape things like on the right side , where i can do it , then i can design them , i can visu@@ alize them like on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side , where i can &apos;t know what is alt and p@@ ill , then i can design it , i can design them sort of cl@@ umin@@ ating things like on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side , when i see things , then i can design you sort of cl@@ old ,
1189 G= we look at that , if i get things up , then i conf@@ using them conf@@ using how on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s sal@@ z and p@@ fe@@ ff@@ er , or i can make it sort of intui@@ tively designing things .
1230 T= that means i &apos;ve cor@@ rup@@ ted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this ob@@ sc@@ ure image .
1230 H= that means that i &apos;ve actually shown you in this dis@@ crimin@@ ation , that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns inside inside , but i have them condi@@ tion@@ ing within shor@@ to@@ ster time always seeing these dog in this literally image image .
1230 G= that is , i &apos;ve actually seen it right now , that they don &apos;t realize no pattern in there , but i have con@@ di@@ tioned it , but i have con@@ di@@ tioned to this dog in this ver@@ meer picture .
710 T= this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the danger@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success .
710 H= that &apos;s how i started thinking about thinking and so i &apos;m working with safety in the last few months during which book working , that will soon become soon -- than vulnerable , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing nom@@ in@@ ator of my pas@@ sen@@ ger nom@@ in@@ ator of my licen@@ se success success .
710 G= so i started thinking , and so i think i worked with safety in the past months , while i was working on the book -- when the dangerous , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , very expected , inten@@ ded success@@ es .
891 T= i study molecular biology and have been doing research into bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more deta@@ iled knowledge and especially wanted to put what i &apos;d learned theore@@ tically into practice .
891 H= and i studied molecular biology biology and i just now just since a few years now , with bio@@ sharks , and i started that because i just wanted to know , because i wanted to really know how to do so in college around theore@@ tical .
891 G= i studied molecular biology , and i &apos;d just been involved in the study of the bio@@ ha@@ cking , and what i started , because i simply wanted to really understand , and it was particularly even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even more specifically , and what i &apos;d like to do in the study of theore@@ tical .
1133 T= i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curi@@ osity and how curi@@ osity in turn trans@@ forms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curi@@ osity and need to give it a j@@ ol@@ t et ce@@ ter@@ a .
1133 H= and i &apos;m switch from house from home , so i &apos;m also working with curi@@ osity theme of curi@@ osity and how changes curi@@ osity lose our thinking again , and why are perhaps also losing curi@@ osity and need to re@@ je@@ ct it again , and i need to re@@ je@@ ct it again and so forth .
1133 G= i &apos;m taken out of the house , so , of course , with the subject of curi@@ osity and how changing curi@@ osity and how changing the curi@@ er also , and why , maybe we &apos;re losing curi@@ osity and so on .
1174 T= and to see when something is intui@@ tive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friend@@ ly , so as intui@@ tive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
1174 H= and when of course , of course , is also something intui@@ tively also , as i take care of influence and just deci@@ ding things like this that they &apos;re a consu@@ mer friend@@ ly , so they make fun , because then fun are fun , because then they fun and are just using them .
1174 G= and when of course , of course something intui@@ tively , and how can i be an activ@@ ist on the things so that it &apos;s a user friend@@ ly , so you have a user mode , well , because they &apos;re fun and fun .
308 T= so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer op@@ tions to choose from .
308 H= so that &apos;s one effect , the other effect is that self when we cross the paraly@@ sis and choo@@ sing a decision , end up spending less satis@@ fied by choo@@ sing the out@@ ele@@ ction of choice , as if we had had had had had had had had had allowed us between less opportunities .
308 G= so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end less happy with the out@@ comes of choice , when if we had the possibility of opportunity to decide .
2535 T= there are other services like how we make ferti@@ li@@ zer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
2535 H= in other remote control , like resource resources , 10@@ 5 5 : 0@@ 5 5 : 0@@ 5 5 : 5 five : 5@@ 6@@ ,@@ 6@@ 6@@ ,@@ 00@@ 5 or air traffic traffic , is play@@ space or air traffic , the play@@ room for impro@@ vement is very much smaller .
2535 G= in other services , like the manufacturing of thin , 10@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or air traffic transport , is the game space for impro@@ v@@ ements is very much smaller .
1280 T= and if i go a step further in these natural user inter@@ faces , where i can control things via voice , speech , touch and gest@@ ure rather than a mouse and cur@@ sor , then i am even faster and more immedi@@ ate .
1280 H= and then , if i still run a step into these oce@@ user intern@@ al where i vote by voices , by language , gest@@ ure , gest@@ ure , gest@@ ure , gest@@ ure the things that i still quick@@ er , i still still be able and even immedi@@ ate .
1280 G= and if i continue one step further into this natural intern@@ al inter@@ faces , where i have per voice , per voice , per touch , per touch and not more per mouse and cur@@ sor that needs things , then i &apos;m going to have more and more un@@ medi@@ able .
1462 T= not burning the bio@@ soli@@ ds a little more , stor@@ ing them and losing all the materials for the cy@@ cles in the in@@ cin@@ er@@ ation plant , but asking on@@ es@@ el@@ f , how do you close cy@@ cles ?
1462 H= not to lose the ligh@@ ting am@@ m nor burning a little bit and burning him laugh@@ ing and burning it burning and burning all kinds of materials for cy@@ stream oper@@ ams , but first time to ask how clo@@ sets you circu@@ it loo@@ p ?
1462 G= not , the ligh@@ ter finally burn a little bit better and burn and burn it with it and put it with it and put it in the burning facili@@ ty , but first time , but let &apos;s first time , but first time , how close you can make a cycle run ?
2320 T= so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sci@@ ences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my bo@@ ss -- and one has come from music .
2320 H= now , when i know all of those individuals i know that the majority of these govern@@ ance are offi@@ ci@@ als , some of science come from science ; some , even less coming from economy . here &apos;s my f , and one comes from music real@@ m . and one comes from music real@@ m .
2320 G= so , if i look at all these people , recognize that the majority of this gover@@ n@@ man , some come from the science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my che@@ f . and one comes from the music section .
2345 T= and i was always absor@@ bed in a book , science fi@@ ction book , which took my mind to other worl@@ ds , and satis@@ fied , in a narra@@ tive form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of curi@@ osity that i had .
2345 H= and my nose always in a book , a sci@@ -@@ fi c@@ tion@@ -@@ book book , which led my thoughts in different worl@@ ds and story@@ t@@ ant , my deeply sac@@ ri@@ cul@@ ous curi@@ osity , un@@ aci@@ ous curi@@ osity wor@@ th@@ ern@@ -@@ curi@@ osity curi@@ osity .
2345 G= and my n@@ ase was always ste@@ ep@@ ed in a book , a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ c@@ tioned book , which ent@@ led my thoughts in other worl@@ ds and to narra@@ tive ways , in@@ sa@@ v@@ able curi@@ osity .

3344 T= now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worl@@ ds .
3344 H= now , the problem of low-@@ oper@@ a@@ tional online worl@@ ds like world farm war@@ craft is that this is so satis@@ fying , any@@ time on the edge of an epi@@ an sie@@ stic vic@@ tory that we rather rather spend our entire time living in these institutions space space .

3320 T= and when we &apos;re in game worl@@ ds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .

1202 T= and if i then place a half o@@ val next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
1202 H= now , if i ski@@ er a se@@ ven@@ val roof , then we &apos;re seeing on one another one , nam@@ ely circle , circle , circle and , but we see one unit , a circle , a circle , another circle , another circle , another circle , another circle , another circle , another sphere another .

1139 T= and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intui@@ tive , increasingly natural , more user friend@@ ly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
1139 H= and there i only move one out of these small sound benefits , because things should become increasingly more intui@@ tive , more natural user users become more users and more use , and there you have to look , which is user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively intui@@ tively .
1139 G= and because it &apos;s just holding one of these little devices , because the things are increasingly intui@@ tive , more natural , used more natural , used to use , which is actually for the people of course , which is actually good for people of course , which is user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively .
1014 T= and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transpor@@ ts you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .
1014 H= and that &apos;s very amazing , because actually you believe that technology is that this technology you see there is that the one really really brings in the future , but indeed , it &apos;s that future is that the future is exactly at us at our arch@@ a@@ an roots .
1014 G= and that &apos;s very surpris@@ ingly , because you really believe that this we@@ technology technology that you face there , which is actually a future in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s so that the future is right in the future , but in fact , the future is just in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .

4956 T= it was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ un@@ k of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ un@@ k of metal and you .
4956 H= this was worth me terrible for all these year in clean room for all of this year in clean room , because , check the mas@@ s@@ rob@@ text difference between one at@@ om at@@ om between one at@@ om and this piece metal metal is about just like the difference between the play metal and all of you .
4956 G= and that was value for all these year in the clean room , because , you see , they te@@ ar it the , the mas@@ s@@ stable difference between one individual at@@ om and that piece of metal is about just as much as the difference between metal metal and them .
4595 T= so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is br@@ and@@ ed from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve-@@ the-@@ ti@@ tle spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x@@ .

4008 T= and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at an@@ atom@@ y , that we reach the point where we have to ad@@ mit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on an@@ atom@@ y might start fall@@ ing apart ?
4008 H= now , for me , what are we going to do is , what are we going to do , what are we going to do is that we need to ad@@ mit that democracy occu@@ pa@@ tions on atoms occu@@ pi@@ ed based on atoms fall@@ ing apart ?
4008 G= and for myself , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science are doing this progress in the corner of the an@@ atom@@ y , that there is a democracy that would occu@@ r on an@@ atom@@ y ?
3605 T= well , they took , over a three-@@ month period , d-@@ level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-@@ month period , they were per@@ forming at a-@@ level .
3605 H= they have then sh@@ opp@@ ed over one three mon@@ th-@@ eight peri@@ graduate student with a &quot; suff@@ i@@ ent &quot; the note &quot; very good &quot; because they said they were very clever that they were very clever , and after those three months they really wrote more empty . and after those three months they really wrote more empty .

2338 T= what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?

2024 T= and so the message is this , we have to make do without these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we actually want to reach our goal of tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y percent , tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , thir@@ ty percent etc .
2024 H= now , the message is now , we need to participa@@ te on these ross mas@@ ses , if we sort of 20th our goals 20 , 20 20 percent 20 percent , 20 percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent and so forth , when we want to achieve the even if we want the even reach@@ ing at all .

1926 T= and then i stuck to it until n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y six and then i became the co-@@ fo@@ under of the company sol@@ on together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world together with the sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ -@@ cells .
1926 H= and then i &apos;ve gone up until si@@ x-@@ and-@@ nine nine volunte@@ ers and then we co-@@ fo@@ unded together with friends i become co-@@ fo@@ under the company company , then become the foot@@ age of the largest cell@@ phone manufac@@ tur@@ maker in the world .
1926 G= and i &apos;ve looked up to se@@ x-@@ und@@ ne@@ un@@ ties and then , with friends , i co-@@ fo@@ unded along with friends , which then combin@@ ed with the sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ -@@ re@@ her@@ er from the sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ -@@ re@@ her@@ er of the world .
1390 T= that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no natu@@ re-@@ et@@ -@@ pro@@ gr@@ Ã¨@@ s or whatever they &apos;re all called , that per@@ mit@@ s our own ex@@ cre@@ ment to be put back into the cycle .
1390 H= that means we feel so inno@@ cent on earth that we say , there isn &apos;t organic far@@ ming far@@ ming , no g@@ ol@@ and , no pro@@ per pro@@ gr@@ ession and how they all hot , allo@@ wing our own ex@@ cre@@ ments return .
1390 G= that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on the earth that we say . there &apos;s no bio@@ -@@ far@@ ming , not a bi@@ ol@@ and , no fin@@ ite pro@@ gr@@ Ã¨@@ s and how they all are , which allow you to all the means that our own ex@@ cre@@ ments .
1157 T= that was also an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t at the time , where the gent@@ ry , c@@ ler@@ gy@@ men and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally f@@ at@@ al of course .
1157 H= at that time &apos; &apos;s as a mon@@ um@@ on@@ t where a@@ need@@ le , cycle , cycle and others said , is you &apos;re really hu@@ gely hum@@ ble when reading the cat@@ begins to read after@@ wards , and of course , of course , is totally f@@ at@@ al .
1157 G= in the time , it &apos;s just a mon@@ r@@ on@@ t , where a@@ del , cla@@ er@@ us and others said , you &apos;re actually in@@ san@@ g , if the people starts , you want to take the after@@ wards , and that &apos;s obviously totally f@@ at@@ al .
6285 T= better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , h@@ d video and still images , libr@@ aries of books and music , medical diagno@@ stic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ ali@@ zing and demon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing into your cell@@ phone .
6285 H= and it comes even better , who have things they spent and i &apos;ve spent multiple dollars -- gps video video video and photograph , libr@@ aries videos and music , technology to medical diagno@@ stics -- become literally un@@ materi@@ alized and che@@ aper in your mobile phone .
6285 G= and it comes better , the things that you and i spend multiple thousand dollars -- gps , h@@ d video and photo , libr@@ aries and photo , libr@@ aries full of books and music , technology is literally dis@@ materi@@ alized and che@@ aper in your cell .
3527 T= so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt is our greatest as@@ set .
3527 H= perhaps so light of this technological transition economic economic change because ever that there had ever had another truth , nam@@ ely anyone who created a different reality , because everyone person who can spend a very special process and can give human ability to ada@@ fit our scale , our largest plus .
3527 G= and perhaps illu@@ str@@ ating that technological transformation , because the one that there was always a other truth , which is that every human of society is something quite special and very powerful and very powerful and powerful , and that the human ability , to suit , ada@@ pt our biggest plus .
2584 T= so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
2584 H= so , there &apos;s big pri@@ ority here : there &apos;s challenges meeting over trans@@ meeting . so , if we say , say that power source outside country lies , they don &apos;t only need the technology that they also need to deal with risk that energy comes from where different from where different comes from where different from where different comes from where different from where different comes from where different from where different comes from where different from where different from where different comes from where different from where different comes from where different choices are going on here is large pri@@ ority of the country here , so there &apos;s big price challenges -- there &apos;s challenges meeting trans@@ duc@@ ation here , so there &apos;s a lot of price challenges here , so , there are challenges meeting trans@@ mission challenges , if we say , say that the source of energy outside country is that the energy source of the country is , if we say , say that the energy source of the country is the power of energy outside the country is , if we say , say , the energy is
2584 G= so there are great pri@@ ces , and there are challenges in the face . if we say for example , that the energy source outside of the country , you don &apos;t need the technology , you need to deal with the risk that the energy from where different .
6054 T= he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ entation of the spirit , a will@@ ing@@ ness to sometimes be in hop@@ eless places and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
6054 H= &quot; as we f@@ ought in eastern europe against under@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted everything possible , but what we needed most needed was hope , was hope to be a legi@@ ti@@ fication that will@@ unity sometimes being less hop@@ eless , being to be hop@@ eless and wit@@ ness . &quot;
6054 G= &quot; when we were fighting in o@@ ta@@ pi@@ a , against the under@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most needed , was a mental gui@@ dance , the will@@ ing@@ ness , the will@@ ing@@ ness , sometimes of hop@@ eless places , and wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing places . &quot;
5705 T= but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
5705 H= in fact -- what i &apos;ve done is , i took taken these code -- the code made out of characters of letters that we use to symbo@@ li@@ ze -- and i wrote my social graphi@@ cs on a piece of dna and rein@@ forced 10 ^ 22 times .
5705 G= in it is -- what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code is from normal letters , which we li@@ ze to symbo@@ lic -- and i &apos;ve written my vis@@ it@@ en@@ map on a piece of dna and wrote 10 ^ 22 times .
4937 T= i mean , when i &apos;m in an el@@ ev@@ ator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , frank@@ ly , sc@@ are them .
4937 H= and i &apos;m my , when i am g alone alone , i do all sorts of weird am@@ ams stuff but then other people go up and i listen to all of these things because i don &apos;t want it to insu@@ pa@@ ir@@ able , or frank@@ ly said they thre@@ ad you .
4937 G= i mean , if i stand alone in the el@@ g , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people clim@@ b and i listen to all of these things , because i don &apos;t leave it with it , or frank@@ ly , frank@@ ly , frank@@ ly .
4511 T= what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive ma@@ inten@@ ance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
4511 H= also what we &apos;ve also found is that the dest@@ ination of attack was actually slow to leave it slowly and inevi@@ t@@ ably happen -- obviously trying to allow engineers to allow engineering engineers that they wouldn &apos;t be able to move quickly at the location that they wouldn &apos;t be able to walk quickly behind it .
4511 G= what we &apos;ve found out is that the goal of the attack of attack , it &apos;s slowly and un@@ mar@@ ked -- obviously in the attemp@@ t engineer engineers des@@ per@@ ate , so they &apos;re not able to be able to go into the situation that they would not be able to go out there .
4314 T= i met these guys called gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a las@@ er poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space .
4314 H= and i met these folks from l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research and they have technology allowed them to pro@@ pose a light on each other surface surface and then to sign a light on any surface surface and sign the negative area only regi@@ ster@@ ed the negative area just regi@@ ster@@ ed the negative area only regi@@ ster@@ ed the negative area only regi@@ ster@@ ed the negative area of regi@@ onal surface , and then to sign a light on any surface surface , and then i met these folks from l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research , and you have a technology allo@@ cated allowed to pro@@ pose a light on any surface of gra@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research , and they have allowed a technology allo@@ wing allowed to pro@@ pose a light on each other surface surface to pro@@ pose a light on any surface surface of cru@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research , and they allowed a technology that allows allowed to try to pro@@ pose a light on each other surface surface , and they allowed a technology that allows allowed to try to pro@@ pose a light on
4314 G= i met these people of gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows you to try to proje@@ ct a light on every arb@@ age surface , and then regi@@ ster@@ ed with a las@@ er@@ pun@@ ter on it , which is regi@@ ster@@ ed the negative surface .
4004 T= henry , by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the x@@ y one -- by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male is now li@@ able to be dra@@ f@@ ted , which mary does not need to worry about .
4004 H= fair enough , because you &apos;re being male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s male -- although i have told that he &apos;s cell@@ y -- because you &apos;re responsible that he can now be attra@@ cted now , not need to make care about brand no@@ ia must not have to be able to make not wor@@ e .
4004 G= h@@ ein@@ rich , because you assu@@ me that he &apos;s male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the x@@ y -- because you assu@@ me that he is male , he can actually put it in , which mar@@ ia has no worry about .
3698 T= so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
3698 H= now , what that means that when we look back on what happens in evolution , and as we think about space in evolution , and as we think about the space in evolution , and mostly how we look looking at next stage , i would say there is there a range of opportunity .
3698 G= so , what that means is , if we look at this , which is happening in evolution , and how we &apos;re thinking about the place of the people in the evolution , and especially as we predi@@ ct in the next phase , i would say that there is a series of possibilities .
90 T= now , the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ cise sort necessary to poten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question .
90 H= now the amazing thing is that the car@@ ta@@ carb@@ ol@@ ol@@ ine , who inclu@@ ded in li@@ an@@ e , are ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors who are kind of necessary to potential tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins , so ask yourself . ask yourself . ask yourself . ask yourself . ask yourself .
90 G= well , the intri@@ gu@@ ing is that the be@@ k@@ k@@ arb@@ ol@@ ine that con@@ tain in the li@@ an@@ e , ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the same way , which is necessary to poten@@ tially poten@@ tially the tra@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
3196 T= and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ g@@ ging the experi@@ en@@ cing self through experiences that the experi@@ en@@ cing self doesn &apos;t need .
3196 H= and basically , you can see that , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of memory of self , and they can remember self reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing himself as one that sort of living living himself worse by experiences that living living self doesn &apos;t need himself .
3196 G= and basically , you can look at that , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ne@@ i of the reme@@ dy themselves , and you can think of themselves as one , which is a sort of kind of re@@ vi@@ ving even worse through experiences that the er@@ alive itself doesn &apos;t need .
361 T= finally , one consequ@@ ence of buying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
361 H= ultimately , a result of buying a poor@@ est je@@ ans when buying only buy one kind of kind of buying is that if they are satis@@ fied , and you wonder why who is responsible , the answer is responsible . the world is responsible . what could you possibly do . the world is responsible . what could you possibly do ?
361 G= finally , a follow of the buy a bad seat je@@ ans if there &apos;s only one way to buy , that if they are un@@ happy , and ask questions why , who accoun@@ ts , the answer is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . what would you do ?
2529 T= in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person .
2529 H= over the rich world in the top world , we might probably make stri@@ str@@ ings and less use , but in average , every year , every year , each year and exp@@ and exp@@ anding more than double the number of services that will be provi@@ ded every single person per person will be provi@@ ded .
2529 G= in the rich world , in the upp@@ er billion , we &apos;re probably able to stri@@ ct and less benefit , but in the average , these number will increase each year and double the number of services that are provi@@ ded per person .
2071 T= and in a mira@@ cle , he li@@ f@@ ted his own vio@@ lin and he started playing , by ear , certain s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of vio@@ lin con@@ cer@@ to@@ s which he then asked me to complete -- men@@ del@@ s@@ sohn , t@@ cha@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , si@@ be@@ li@@ us .

733 T= this is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the arc@@ tic ocean , where there is a massive amount of fro@@ zen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into me@@ than@@ e by micro@@ bes .
733 H= now , this is a problem that warming causes liber@@ als for the arc@@ tic ocean , in which there gives major amo@@ unts of carbon carbon , which , when he si@@ ts to me@@ than@@ e , which , when he blo@@ ws to me@@ than@@ e of micro@@ bes .
733 G= this is a problem , since the fro@@ zen reason to record the arc@@ tic ocean to record the arc@@ tic ocean , where there &apos;s a huge quanti@@ ty of fro@@ zen carbon , which , if he looked up , of micro@@ bes .
529 T= it &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the l@@ h@@ c , colli@@ ding with a piece of the l@@ h@@ c deli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing particles into the dete@@ ctor .
529 H= this is an image of the original radiation musical rock which le@@ f@@ ts rec@@ la@@ p back the l@@ h@@ c back , then ad@@ ding a part of the l@@ c col@@ li@@ di@@ di to allow a rain of particles to rele@@ ase a rain of particles on the dete@@ ctor pr@@ as@@ lets .

502 T= but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is if we start with co2 as its feed@@ stock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
502 H= but what we think like , the only kind of biology has a huge impact redu@@ ction of cost of food resources or restri@@ ction of their avail@@ ability , if we see co2 as ex@@ original material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that are going to go to cells that walk these path .
502 G= but , as we think , the only way to do biology is a great impact without further ste@@ pping on food , or the limit@@ ation of their avail@@ ability , if we look at co2 as a foreign material , and so we work on the cells that go out of the way .
440 T= and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .

6217 T= my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jum@@ ps on this cur@@ ve , on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months .
6217 H= now my good friend ray kurz@@ weil has shown us that every one of us becoming technology capit@@ alism , based on the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law of mo@@ or@@ -@@ law power , all 12 to 24 months .
6217 G= my good friend ray kurz@@ weil has shown you that every tool that will go to the computer technology technology , the kur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law great spr@@ in@@ ings , and the price performance source qu@@ o@@ tic all 12 to 24 months .
4241 T= and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can invol@@ ve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call cloud raising -- like bar@@ n raising , but with a cloud .
4241 H= again , again , imagine taking this before we engage people to engage with engage and change the environment -- almost as something that we call -- almost as something we call called cloud motion motion as you move a sche@@ un@@ deci@@ or moves , but moves on a cloud .
4241 G= the idea is , imagine , imagine what we &apos;re going to do with the people to do something , and to change the environment -- almost as something , like what we call it , wol@@ ken@@ motion , like a tun@@ a , but with a cloud .
4311 T= i commit@@ ted to his brother and his father right then and there -- i &apos;m like , &quot; all right , here &apos;s the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
4311 H= and i applied to his brother and place to his brother and his father -- saying , &quot; well my pro@@ pos@@ al is following : tony &apos;s going to talk : tony will talk to him , and we will find a path@@ way , and we will find a path that he can re@@ move again .

3569 T= there &apos;s evidence that ne@@ anderth@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ j@@ ury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
3569 H= there are evidence that already the ne@@ ander@@ tal@@ / / 7@@ 0,000 years ago older people older people older people and people with sever@@ ous bodies in@@ j@@ ury and did the happened , because the li@@ fes@@ li@@ hood of that human life for society was valuable .
3569 G= there &apos;s evidence that there is the ne@@ anderth@@ al , 6@@ 0,000 years older people , and people with sever@@ e physical inje@@ ctions with ge@@ ars , and what happened perhaps , because the life experience is valuable .
3889 T= i &apos;m a histor@@ ian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have de@@ alt with an@@ atom@@ y -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they de@@ alt with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ ids , concep@@ ts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
3889 H= i am studied histor@@ i@@ ker@@ c@@ and@@ in , and in this case i study how people walked across atoms -- which body body body , animal body body , animal body body , animal body body -- like they were working with bodies concep@@ ts ; like thinking about bodies . like thinking about bodies .
3889 G= i &apos;m studying histor@@ i@@ ker@@ in , and in this case , i study how people killed an@@ atom@@ y -- d.@@ h@@ . human body , animal body -- as they killed physical sig@@ ns , with body concep@@ ts , with body concep@@ ts , with body concep@@ ts , with body concep@@ ts , with body concep@@ ts .
3926 T= the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ fis@@ m , or it &apos;s con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ inning , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often norm@@ alized by surge@@ ons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
3926 H= the reason why kids interact with this kind of body -- whether it grew prof@@ gen@@ ia or s@@ am@@ ical t@@ l@@ es , whether it &apos;s sexual sexual -- sur@@ surgeon often fit the nor@@ m , isn &apos;t being adap@@ ted for their physical health of advantage .
3926 G= the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it grew up or si@@ am@@ es@@ ic tw@@ l@@ flies , be intern@@ al -- surge@@ ons are often adap@@ ted to the nor@@ m , is not , because this is an advantage of the nor@@ m .
2849 T= so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ fo@@ ods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pas@@ sing on nature &apos;s ground .
2849 H= now , i also wrote an article about a article too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would &quot; fran@@ ken@@ food &quot; why they believed that molecules focused on a certain kind of rand@@ om@@ ly wrong kind of trans@@ lation on nature of nature .
2849 G= so , i wrote a paper about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why they thought , &quot; fran@@ ken@@ food , &quot; why they believed that molecules in a particular rather than a random way of dealing with the field of nature .
2565 T= what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it sta@@ ys there .
2565 H= now what you have to do , may seem , may just seem , but it &apos;s not . you have to burn all co2 burning burning burning from the bri@@ re@@ stone stone , catch pressure and laugh@@ ing somewhere there somewhere somewhere and hope that there are still there .
2565 G= what you have there is , it &apos;s just easy , but it &apos;s not . you &apos;d all the co2 that &apos;s burning after the sna@@ il of the scot@@ land , including pressure , and then you hope that there &apos;s sta@@ yed there and hope that there is there .
4331 T= we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , ha@@ cked it open , moun@@ ted it to an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publi@@ sh the code for free , you down@@ load the software for free .
4331 H= we took one camera camera , they &apos;ve built apart , they set up on a li@@ d-@@ light light , and now we have rele@@ ased a device free -- you can build the code free for free , allo@@ wing the code free to provide free code free for free free .
4331 G= we took a p@@ s@@ 3@@ -@@ camera , you &apos;ve built it out , put it on a le@@ d-@@ light , and now we have a device that &apos;s acc@@ essi@@ ble -- you can build the code , we can down@@ load the code , the software can down@@ load free free .
5147 T= by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ roll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sav@@ ings account by four percent .
5147 H= in which we do these simple thing in which we did was take an increase in participa@@ tion dec@@ line 20 percent , and there had been a rise of the amount of people who were ready to save four percent when they were willing to pay for four percent when they were willing to pay for the price accoun@@ ts .

5510 T= so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rock@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
5510 H= now , a few years ago , i &apos;ve launched a program to get the stars in technology and design to get a year off and working in an environment that is so pretty everything they actually hate what they actually hate hate , we have they working in government working in government .
5510 G= so a few years , i started a program , we started a program , a year , and design a year and design a year , and in a environment , which is pretty much all this , what it actually is , what it is actually hun@@ ting , we &apos;ve been working in the government .

2723 T= and since then , i &apos;ve condu@@ cted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ ops across the world with students and designers and architec@@ ts , even the c@@ to@@ s of the fortun@@ e 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reve@@ als very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
2723 H= since since , since i &apos;ve appro@@ ved about 70 work@@ sh@@ ops worldwide glob@@ alization , students and architect , even with death death company leading 5@@ 0-@@ dollar company and there &apos;s something deep on that task , which makes sense of collaboration and i &apos;d like to share some of them with them .

978 T= but that &apos;s my my prototyp@@ e , which looked pretty wild though , on a bran@@ ch and that , that thing on it , put the electr@@ on@@ ics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke .
978 H= but that &apos;s so my magnetic y@@ p but hasn &apos;t seen pretty driving , so on such a bran@@ ch that pus@@ hed on , electric electr@@ on@@ ics and pres@@ sion , but it was also pressure too high , broken thing was too high , broken thing , broken thing was broken .
978 G= but this is so my prototyp@@ e , which has been quite dead , so on this one hand , so on this one hand , the thing on , electr@@ on@@ ics , and that was the pressure , and the pressure was too high , the thing is broken .
1152 T= that was a massive out@@ cry at the time , because of course it was when the li@@ vely language started to mani@@ fest itself in writing , meaning that i took something flu@@ id and alive and started to car@@ ve it in stone and so manipu@@ late it .
1152 H= that was then a giant scre@@ w@@ cry , because of course you &apos;d become mani@@ fest the living language to mani@@ fest the living language inspired by writing , which means what flu@@ id and alive is catch it in stone and manipu@@ lation i also manipu@@ lation it in stone and manipu@@ lation also in stone and manipu@@ lation also i also .
1152 G= and that was a giant sh@@ in@@ i , because of course tou@@ ching the living language in the form of writing , which means what flu@@ id flu@@ id and alive , size , and then manipu@@ late it in stone and so manipu@@ late it in stone and manipu@@ late it .
689 T= because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , o@@ .@@ k. -- cent@@ u@@ ries ago in the deser@@ ts of north africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of sac@@ red dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until da@@ wn .

939 T= but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
939 H= and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively shir@@ er@@ er@@ ous , so that &apos;s hang on people who make themselves home home to large organizations that provide more generally , the budget that produced increasing more forms already run in institu@@ tion@@ alized form already run in institu@@ tion@@ alization form already run already in institu@@ tion@@ alization form already run already in institu@@ tion@@ alized form .
939 G= and yes , well , you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene , so that &apos;s the rest of people who do that alone in da@@ heim , to large organizations , which is the larger organizations that do much more for@@ mal form .
966 T= so when i now that &apos;s what the what pro@@ fil@@ ers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair sam@@ ples , and then they make these imple@@ ment this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair bel@@ on@@ gs to this person , like that .
966 H= so now , if i now make the film@@ makers going place in crime , then they go anywhere there any hair sam@@ ar@@ es , and then these apply these metho@@ d@@ tives then can say this method , o@@ .@@ k , this hair heard of this hair , this hair bel@@ on@@ ey to this people like this hair .
966 G= so if i now do this , the proje@@ ctor on the scene , go out there , collect some ha@@ ar@@ sam@@ es , and then do these kinds of approach this way , and then you can tell you , o@@ .@@ k , this ha@@ ar is that people , so .
136 T= he sk@@ inn@@ ed the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and disappe@@ ared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it kni@@ fe in b@@ elt .

2015 T= we look into this network , see the fif@@ ty her@@ tz , and if it turns into for@@ ty nine point nine her@@ tz , we start to open a few small val@@ ves , then a little more ste@@ am can enter , and then it goes up again .
2015 H= we look inside that web inside this web , the 50 sands fall , and when it becomes nin@@ th fourth commercial commercial , we start making some venti@@ l@@ flies , we start making a little bit of fan , then we come back a be@@ half va@@ w dam , then we come back up again , we come back up again .
2015 G= we &apos;re looking at in this network , you see the fif@@ ty her@@ tz , and if it gets nin@@ e-@@ and-@@ four@@ -@@ four com@@ ma will be nine , we &apos;re going to go back to a bi@@ king mer@@ h dam@@ k , then come up with a bi@@ king mer@@ h dam@@ n , then come up .
1182 T= and there you see that , that people a our seven sen@@ ses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven offi@@ cially re@@ co@@ g@@ nis@@ ed sen@@ ses , and in the near future the next , the ei@@ gh@@ th sense will probably be ad@@ ded to it and as an exten@@ sion of ourselves again .
1182 H= now , you already see that a a our seven sense that most think we only think about five , now now &apos; &apos; s already seen seven recogni@@ tion , there &apos;s probably seven next next to the next , a@@ dness meaning , and also as exten@@ sion also again our ourselves .
1182 G= and since it is , you see that you have a our seven sen@@ ses that we have only five , now there &apos;s only seven , now , there &apos;s certainly seven , there &apos;s certainly in na@@ her future , and as a exp@@ and of the next , a@@ em@@ ness and exp@@ and as a exp@@ and again .
1273 T= then came the next ones , which already worked with a neu@@ ral model or mental model , as software er@@ gon@@ om@@ ists say , because you &apos;d have a con@@ ception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer us@@ able .
1273 H= then the next that the next now , with m neu@@ ral neu@@ onic model or mental model like the software dri@@ vers say , who have worked , because you have had a idea of something that metaphor is possible to make the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top to make the computer use .
1273 G= then the next ones that are now with &apos; ne@@ me neu@@ on@@ al model , or mental model like the software e@@ er@@ gon@@ ists say , which is a picture of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to use using computers .

6172 T= and so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a bi@@ cycle , for low-@@ level property cri@@ mes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they vic@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed .
6172 H= now we have , &quot; three wa@@ gs &quot; law , people bring people behind lat@@ ters behind lat@@ ter for a bi@@ ke steel steel sta@@ steel for the th@@ b@@ steel gri@@ d@@ steel good , instead that you forces forced to give the oper@@ ations back to sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ es that bring things back to the sac@@ ri@@ ts .

4032 T= i &apos;m gla@@ d to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins in order to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name for himself .
4032 H= so i &apos;m too able to say that we have not have these conditions -- a surgeon who i spoke several years ago who talked a few years ago who spoke some si@@ am@@ ical t@@ l@@ es who had brought them to separate them a names .
4032 G= i &apos;m gla@@ d to say that we haven &apos;t talked about this -- a surgeon with which i talked about a few years , which was a few years , which was a few years of si@@ am@@ es@@ ic tw@@ ins with themselves , part of a name .
3677 T= now i have to conf@@ ess , when i was a college under@@ graduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with each pas@@ sing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing dou@@ b@@ ts .
3677 H= now i have to stand , when i was a college graduate student , i &apos;d like , ok , sex / death , sex dying death death death death death -- it appe@@ ared pretty sensi@@ ble at time , but every year , it came to my increasing secon@@ dar@@ ing dou@@ bt .

4502 T= in order to get target theor@@ ies , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hard@@ core s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it must be a high-@@ value target and it is most likely lo@@ cated in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infe@@ ctions had been repor@@ ted .
4502 H= now , around these theor@@ ies , we call ourselves memory that definitely is definitely about high-@@ gra@@ ding spor@@ ts , it has to act to negoti@@ ate a high-@@ quality goal and very likely to iran in iran because most infe@@ ctions were repor@@ ted in iran because most infe@@ ctions were repor@@ ted .
4502 G= to record that the@@ ori@@ zation , we call ourselves in reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing that it &apos;s defined by highly high s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age is a high-@@ value goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because there is the most infe@@ cted infe@@ ctions .
4116 T= now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m itali@@ an origin@@ ally , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y gro@@ ws up with this picture on the wall of his bedro@@ om -- but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in for@@ mul@@ a 1 ra@@ cing over the past couple of decades .

4116 G= so if you take this picture -- i &apos;m origin@@ ally itali@@ an , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y , but the reason why i show you this is what i &apos;m showing you here is something very interesting happened .
4042 T= and what we know from cros@@ s-@@ cultural studies is that fe@@ mal@@ es , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more in@@ clin@@ ed to be very atten@@ tive to complex social rela@@ tions and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
4042 H= now what we &apos;ve learned from cultural monit@@ or@@ end studies have learned is women , average per average average -- no every one , but average average -- rather cost social relationships and fear care for people who live within group vulnerable , are very much attention to people who live within group vulnerable , are very much attention .
4042 G= what we learned from cultural studies studies , is that women , in average -- not every , but average -- not any , but average -- rather tend to tend to tend to more complex social relationships and the fear for people who are w@@ und@@ able , very much attention .
147 T= we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- -- we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs are not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we think that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best story@@ telling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
147 H= and we believe that po@@ emp@@ k -- we believe po@@ le-@@ mi@@ cs isn &apos;t really convin@@ cing , but we believe story@@ telling that story@@ telling share the world change and therefore we are probably the best institution for story@@ telling in the world -- our website recei@@ ves 35 million hits every month .
147 G= we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ k -- we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ k is not convin@@ cing , but we believe that histor@@ ic telling the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for histor@@ ic . our website get 35 million dinosau@@ r .
3962 T= i mean , they were so bra@@ ve and so b@@ old and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musical &quot; 17@@ 7@@ 6 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
3962 H= so i think they were so ta@@ pe@@ er and strong , and so radical , where what they did did i bring all of me for da@@ da@@ ging the sch@@ mal@@ zi@@ ge of 20@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because the music that is absolutely forget about music , forget absolutely forget about music , forget absolutely forget .
3962 G= i find that they were so ta@@ gi@@ er and strong , and so radi@@ cally , in which what they did is that i made all of the few years of er@@ ta@@ ppe the sch@@ mal@@ ci@@ ge of 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten .
898 T= and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as wash@@ ing po@@ w@@ der enzy@@ mes , which allow us to was@@ h clo@@ th@@ es at for@@ ty degrees , which are also gene@@ tically optimis@@ ed enzy@@ mes .
898 H= there &apos;s also already stuff that are occu@@ cated throughout everyday everyday , but most people are not aware of what most people but but really not consci@@ ously realize for example , allow us to was@@ h 4@@ 50 degrees wat@@ ered too optimi@@ stic enzy@@ mes .
898 G= under you , there &apos;s also some things that are completely appropriate in the everyday day , which is not aware of , for example , elec@@ ti@@ mi@@ zing enzy@@ mes that allow us to was@@ h with four@@ -@@ degree ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing enzy@@ mes , are gene@@ tically optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes .
3311 T= and this is the face that we need to see on millions of proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ stac@@ les of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds is on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
3311 H= and that &apos;s what we have to see on millions of faces all over the world , if we take the barri@@ rier of the next century , which is the face of the next century in attack the face of all wi@@ third markets on the edge of any wi@@ third sett@@ on on the edge of one epi@@ c sett@@ le@@ ments on the edge of an epi@@ stic sett@@ le@@ ments .

2744 T= what kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prototyp@@ es , suc@@ c@@ essi@@ ve prototyp@@ es , always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototyp@@ es along the way .
2744 H= now , what kinder@@ garten children are different is that they start building models and prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , more successful prototyp@@ es , working with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ pain@@ ts at the top , so they have multiple times the possibility of fix@@ able prototyp@@ es .
2744 G= what children garden children are different is that they &apos;re building with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and prototyp@@ es , the more successful prototyp@@ es , still with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so that they have multi-@@ fa@@ che prototyp@@ es .
2691 T= i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ engineering discussion about -- should that be in the back po@@ cket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slo@@ wer than we expect ?
2691 H= i don &apos;t know whether this is clear , if you lead the importance of this problem is leading this problem in front of eye , but now there &apos;s a class class in ge@@ o@@ engineering about whether to get the things faster if we expect .
2691 G= i don &apos;t know if the smart is , if you look at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a dis@@ course in ge@@ o@@ engineering about if you do that , if you do that , if you do that , if you do that , if that innovation needs faster , or this innovation longer than we expect .
2420 T= as we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent expedi@@ tions , i was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and ima@@ ged them .
2420 H= during several of the following expedi@@ tions i saw being seen in mal@@ mal@@ ots , and sometimes things i hadn &apos;t seen before , sometimes things i had never seen before , sometimes things ever had previ@@ ously had been seen for science for time we saw they didn &apos;t found words anymore .
2420 G= in some of the following expedi@@ tions , i &apos;ve seen creatures seen in ther@@ mal@@ sources , and sometimes things that had never seen before , sometimes even even before , and for the science of the stage , when we looked at them , even no words .
5764 T= instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstra@@ ction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
5764 H= instead of what i instead , instead of making the designers of work is , we &apos;re thinking about a degree of abstra@@ ction sector , spending this machine and power power power makes something far beyond our skills better and faster than we could ever make it far more and faster than ever we could ever do it .
5764 G= what i do instead , and what the designer of thinking is , is , we &apos;re thinking on a certain abstra@@ ct of abstra@@ ct , spending these of the machine , and the machine does something that increase our skills far , better and faster than we ever do itself .
3549 T= so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embra@@ cing it , gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ rest@@ ling term , maybe even dan@@ cing with it .
3549 H= perhaps , it &apos;s perhaps more about asking clear reali@@ zation that we don &apos;t necessarily need to over@@ come , but that we are free to hu@@ mp it for hu@@ mp too pack a cam@@ band@@ -@@ term and maybe even dance to dance and maybe even dance to dance and maybe even dance to dance and maybe even dance .
3549 G= it &apos;s perhaps more about that , reali@@ zing that we need wi@@ dri@@ ties not necessarily over@@ come , but that we are open to open , you go to the hu@@ b , you can get a cam@@ pe@@ -@@ expression , and maybe even dance with it .
3500 T= i mean , from this ent@@ ry , it would seem that i was born into a world that percei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today i &apos;m cele@@ br@@ ated for the opportunities and ad@@ vent@@ ures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
3500 H= if i would take that post seriously i &apos;d be taking in a world that anyone would percei@@ ve as a person who would percei@@ ve living in k@@ uni@@ stic way positive life can run , but today i &apos;m cele@@ br@@ ated for the opportunities and ad@@ vent@@ ure that i &apos;ve experienced .

5114 T= when the gol@@ den c@@ at corpo@@ ration got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling c@@ at li@@ tter products , they saw an increase in prof@@ its by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in sal@@ es and lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs .
5114 H= as the gol@@ den c@@ ad corpo@@ ration her 10 most worst sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ran@@ us attac@@ ked c@@ scen@@ attac@@ us , they were willing to clim@@ bed 8@@ 7 percent increase -- a result from both the rise of selling sal@@ es and reduce reduce dec@@ lar@@ ation costs and reduce reduce reduce cost from cost .

4648 T= this is was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free from pre@@ ten@@ se or dec@@ eit ; easily dete@@ cted or seen through ; re@@ adi@@ ly understood ; characteri@@ zed by visi@@ bility or acc@@ essi@@ bility of information , especially concern@@ ing business practic@@ es -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
4648 H= this was : transpar@@ ency -- free from del@@ destruction and bag@@ cei@@ ling , just discover and look through ; inst@@ antly obvious ; human@@ it@@ ori@@ zed from entrop@@ bility and access information to information , especially what valu@@ dur@@ ability is -- the last layer is probably the biggest problem .

4423 T= we have this bu@@ cket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn &apos;t , all the f@@ ences i wanted to mend , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .
4423 H= we &apos;ve learned these plan plan that we want to make these things that we want to live living in in life and i thought all the people that i wanted to rich and didn &apos;t indeed , all the f@@ ences i wanted to wan@@ ting all the experience i wanted to make and never made .

4172 T= so we actually started with a number of volunte@@ ers who helped us in se@@ attle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were thro@@ wing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
4172 H= so we &apos;ve started starting with some volunte@@ ers us who have helped us look more than one year sitting in se@@ attle who helped tag@@ ged things they war@@ med -- different types of things they can see -- things they &apos;d thro@@ wa@@ way off -- things they would throw away thro@@ wa@@ way off .
4172 G= so we started with some volunte@@ ers that we &apos;re looking at , something more than a year , in se@@ attle , who are waiting for the things that you &apos;re waiting for -- different kinds of things that you can see o@@ h@@ ne@@ toward away .
4021 T= i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of humans , because , i have to ad@@ mit , that there are some gol@@ den re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s i know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some humans i know .
4021 H= also , i want to suggest also that i &apos;m not sure that we should divi@@ de rights to people in humans , because i need to say that i have a range of gold recor@@ ds that probably more soci@@ ali@@ zations more deser@@ ti@@ als more deser@@ ti@@ als more deser@@ ti@@ als more deser@@ ve than some people i know .
4021 G= i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re not sure that we are right in terms of human beings , because i must ad@@ mit , that i know a series of gol@@ den re@@ tri@@ ever knows than some people who are probably more likely than some people who i know .

1565 G= that man is not just transl@@ ated word for word the text is trans@@ mit@@ ted in a different language , but even the deep meaning of the words and wor@@ thy optimis@@ m , so there &apos;s a sense of good trans@@ lation , everybody knows that it has to do with stran@@ gest languages .
302 T= understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .
302 H= understand that this isn &apos;t only means that food food food eating food when they walk inside the distance , because they didn &apos;t have enough money back to back , because they have not enough money making decisions so hard that they make large investment supply supply of their labor custom@@ ers .
302 G= you understand that that doesn &apos;t mean , that people have food food food , if you go in the ru@@ he@@ stood , because they don &apos;t enough money to return , it does mean that they have great invest@@ ments bo@@ ats of their labor .
6605 T= for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that some present , as cap@@ tain so-@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ tili@@ zed by fis@@ her@@ y scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;

3139 H= and then it &apos;s a rec@@ harv@@ est@@ ing self , and this memory self is that coun@@ ting compassion , and the story of life is right , and it &apos;s the one who spea@@ ks physi@@ cian asking asking asking asking asking the question , &quot; how did you feel emotion@@ ally ? &quot;
3139 G= and then there &apos;s a memor@@ ial of itself , and that reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed yourself , and the story of our lives , and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s that the doctor talks about , &quot; how did you feel felt in the last time ? &quot;
3105 T= people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
3105 H= people back out or the ones seeing the later suddenly see on video , say , &quot; now yes , seeing this looks quite pr@@ pressure full of , but if it was really , he &apos;d see -- see -- see , there &apos;s a hole and that if it really would be flo@@ ated , it would flo@@ wers . &quot; right ? &quot;
3105 G= the people back , or the , you see , at some point , you &apos;ll say , &quot; well , yes , that looks quite clo@@ sely , but if it &apos;s real , it would be a hole and there , here &apos;s a hole and there , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it would really be real if it would be really real , it would flo@@ at . &quot;
5469 T= and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , dou@@ bled demand and things like that .
5469 H= at that point where patients come into play . they can not only be the control of adop@@ tion capit@@ ams on their ship , but can help us address health fac@@ tions that lie facing us as well as the free explosion of healthcare , twice the cost of healthcare , twice double demand demand , and so forth .
5469 G= in this point , patients in the game , and you can &apos;t only take the control of their own ship , but you can help health care of health care , but may be helping care of the challenges that are wrong , and the free explosion of the health care , double demand , and so on .
5118 T= now in the financial sav@@ ings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice off@@ er@@ ings has actually been something that david la@@ ib@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
5118 H= now in the world of saving , i believe one of the best examples who &apos;ve come recently come to market recently , how best you argue about the best choices of choice , was something that david char@@ ib@@ son has worked very strong with harvard , it &apos;s a program at harvard who will come anywhere at harvard .
5118 G= well in the world of the sav@@ ings , i think of one of the best examples that are recently taken on the market , about how man is man@@ ual man@@ ual , was something that has a great deal with the david la@@ ib@@ son &apos;s very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s off@@ ered at harvard .
5001 T= so the ted@@ talk la@@ id out in very simple terms , a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited land , a char@@ ter that speci@@ fi@@ es the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in , to go live under those rules or not .
5001 H= so , the ted@@ talk said , in very simple shape that a char@@ ter city is a place where very aw@@ living country is , a fo@@ under@@ -@@ the-@@ market treat@@ ments that gover@@ nor rul@@ ers decide to decide either living under those rules or not living with those rules or not living in those rules or not .
5001 G= so ted@@ talk , in a very simple form , that a char@@ ter city is a place where ini@@ tially un@@ lived country , a fo@@ unding country , a fo@@ unding country that determin@@ es the laws of choice , either under this rules , either under this rules or not .
4583 T= so what you were getting was this : your name here pres@@ ents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depen@@ ding on the content , could ultimately b@@ low up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
4583 H= so what you know was , what you know is : your name here : my ted@@ talk , which you don &apos;t know what being being being being being being going across after cont@@ us@@ us@@ us@@ al@@ ly fly the e@@ ars could fly , especially if i sit your company for their participa@@ tion .
4583 G= so what i thought was , her name here : her name here : my ted@@ talk , who you have no idea , which is the top@@ ic , and the one of them depen@@ ding on the e@@ ye@@ flies , especially , if i lay out their company for their participa@@ tion .
4532 T= now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the input values from sensor@@ s -- so for example , from pressure sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tion sensor@@ s -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ mate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fa@@ ke input data .
4532 H= now , what this thing is is that it begins cat@@ ching the end values from sensor@@ es -- so for example of pres@@ sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tional sensor@@ s -- and provide legi@@ ti@@ ms of code that still during attack , walking through fol@@ ding data , walking through fol@@ ding data , running wrong data , running wrong data , running wrong .
4532 G= well , what works that this thing works is that it starts with sensor@@ s values -- so , for example , prin@@ sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tional sensor@@ s , vi@@ bra@@ tional sensor@@ s -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ ms code , with fol@@ ding data , running with fal@@ se data .
43 T= we tra@@ ced gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight generations , and we found two in@@ stances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
43 H= and then we followed eight generations eight generations , and we found two cases of death death and we spent two cases of death and as we asked people wonder@@ ing that one of the people become become so old that he had died died of his age died and we dau@@ gh@@ ted him still working with the spe@@ ver .
43 G= we followed the gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations , and two cases of a natural death , and two cases of a natural death and when we asked the people to print something about it , that one of the people turned old , and we killed him with the spe@@ ars .
91 T= how , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cular plants , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally un@@ related plants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
91 H= how can these people com@@ bine from an fle@@ or@@ a from 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ road industry plants find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologist not related plants that combin@@ ed together , create kind of create organic version of organic version , create kind of create organic version of bio@@ chemical version , how do the total parts of its parts ?
91 G= how can these people are combin@@ ed from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 ways of ad@@ string plants find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally not related plants , combin@@ ing a way of bio@@ chemical version , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts ?
3048 T= and we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fing@@ ers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
3048 H= and now you could talk about why this is an illusion that you don &apos;t percei@@ ve why you &apos;re not percei@@ ving that down below only three finger : because understanding understood and kind of how process@@ ing information process@@ es , one , two , three , three , three , three , three , three , but they looks as a group .
3048 G= and now , you could talk about why this is a de@@ ception is why you &apos;re not percei@@ ving , that here &apos;s only three fing@@ ers , because the mind and the way it works information , it doesn &apos;t matter , one , two , three , but it sees it as a group .
2637 T= if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a v@@ acc@@ ine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
2637 H= for example , if you only choose a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose choo@@ sele@@ ction , a vac@@ cin@@ es , and love me , or i could choose that wish , sustainable source whe@@ el &apos;s without co2 , i could take the president , i could take the president of no co2 . i wish i could take the president . i mean that wish i could take the president of the next 50 years , i could take a wish for the next 50 years , if you only choose a wish for the next 50 years i could only choose for the next 50 years i could choose the next 50 years , i could choose choo@@ sing the next 50 years , i could choose choo@@ sing for the next 50 years , i could choose the president of presi@@ dents who choose the next 50 years , i could choose cho@@ sen for the next 50 years , i could choose sele@@ ction for the next 50 years , i could choose the president for the next 50 years , i could choose the next 50 years ,

2062 T= but as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these schizophren@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des , the worst of which can mani@@ fest themselves as and then disappe@@ aring for days , wander@@ ing the streets of sk@@ id row , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed upon him .
2062 H= and as a result , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable for those cas@@ hor@@ es of those schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases . those are sometimes disappe@@ ar , and he disappe@@ ars disappe@@ aring across sc@@ id stre@@ t@@ ching across the streets of sc@@ id stre@@ ams and tracking the tor@@ que of your own spirit of your own ambi@@ ti@@ ous expression .
2062 G= as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases . these are sometimes so bad , and it disappe@@ ars so bad , and it disappe@@ ars , in the streets of sc@@ id row around the streets of sc@@ id row around that hor@@ ror and ex@@ posed the tor@@ qu@@ als of his own mind .
406 T= when we look at its me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a living cell .
406 H= now , when we see these met@@ o@@ o@@ bottle map , which is very simpli@@ stic , compar@@ ison versus our . trust me , which is simpli@@ le . but all when we all look at those genes that we can lead one after another one , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would lead to one living cell .
406 G= but if we look at this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ man map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust them , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes are looking at one to the other one is very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell .
334 T= and there was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ vor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra@@ p , and they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if you wor@@ e them long enough and wash@@ ed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
334 H= and there was one time where only everybody had given any kind of one , and they bought them , and they fit lo@@ aded , and they &apos;ve mis@@ sed , they were incredibly inevi@@ table and if they had long enough wash@@ ed and had enough wash@@ gun , they started feeling &quot; ok &quot; to feel . &quot;
334 G= and there was a time in which there were always any kind of a way , and they bought it , and they f@@ f@@ ed bad , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable and often enough enough , you have enough un@@ comp@@ elling , and if they had long enough , they started &quot; ok . &quot;
6418 T= about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs brought her back to the emergen@@ cy department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in sever@@ e sho@@ ck .
6418 H= about an hour she had arrived at home she had ended down@@ sta@@ irs after night they ended down@@ sta@@ irs , collap@@ sed them and the family named 9@@ 11 . saving saving assi@@ stant they brought back 50 blood pressure from 50 , this is dangerous cho@@ col@@ able condition of 50 , this is dangerous cho@@ tri@@ cky condition .
6418 G= about one hour after that she arrived at home , after i took it home , after i sent it home , it collap@@ sed and called the family called 9@@ 11 . the res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion assi@@ stant house with a blood pressure of 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous sho@@ ck state .
126 T= and it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ dens find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
126 H= and in that song we become repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly being dete@@ cted to be reali@@ zing what we are : people with popular awareness who consci@@ ously consci@@ ously realize everybody and gar@@ dens to be able to be able to be able to be able . and there &apos;s wonderful moments of optimis@@ m . and there &apos;s wonderful moments of optimis@@ m .
126 G= and in this song , we &apos;re going to re@@ discover the possibility that we are : people with fol@@ lem , who consci@@ ously aware of the importance of importance , that all people and g@@ arb@@ age is a room of ge@@ ar . and there &apos;s great moments of the organis@@ m .
1100 T= there are technical concep@@ ts such as <<unk>> aug@@ mented reality <<unk>> .
1100 H= so once they look at google glas@@ ses for google glas@@ ses , then this is such a concept which allows us combin@@ ing the virtual world with the real world worldwide world combin@@ ing our aff@@ ir@@ ity to identify virtu@@ ally percei@@ ved virtual than something ordinary , natural as something ordinary , more natural to find more natural than something more common , and then again .
1100 G= so if you look at google glass glas@@ ses , then it &apos;s such a concept that makes the virtual world with the real world with real world with real world , which is to embra@@ ce our mon@@ in@@ ity to virtual architecture , which is virtual as something normal , natural , natural .
2563 T= those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .
2563 H= now those contribu@@ tion perhaps contribu@@ tion one more modern , as i expect , this is great , but my core stat@@ ement is that we need to work on all those those five five five five work , and we can &apos;t give them sh@@ ame because all of us have been afraid because all of us have exi@@ sted problems .
2563 G= so , maybe you have a moder@@ ate contribu@@ tion , and if you do better than i expect , this would be great , but my nuclear ex@@ ecu@@ tion here is that we have to work on all j@@ ens , and we can &apos;t get out of them , because they &apos;re un@@ prote@@ cted , because all of the problems have significant problems .
2566 T= now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tri@@ cky , and agre@@ eing on where these co2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long-term issue .
2566 H= there are several pilot pil@@ ots that create at a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but getting 100 percent of 80 percent -- 80 percent level , but getting one ig@@ mon@@ ment for the stor@@ ation of co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest issue here is the cam@@ ti@@ time question . but the biggest issue here is the cam@@ time question . but the biggest issue here is the cam@@ ti@@ time question .
2566 G= there are some mush@@ ot@@ projects that can do that in a 60 percent -- 80 percent levels of level , but it will get to 100 percent , and a one-@@ ig@@ ung for the la@@ p of co2 , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the la@@ ger question .
3018 T= for some time i have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a ma@@ gi@@ cian to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &quot; something fa@@ ke is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
3018 H= for several time , for a few time , i &apos;m possible for the plac@@ e@@ bo effect . it might seem strange that a me@@ po@@ gi@@ cian is interested , whether it &apos;s as an illusion that belie@@ ves something true when somebody just belie@@ ves something enough when somebody &apos;s only belie@@ vable enough that if somebody &apos;s only belie@@ vable enough to believe that if somebody &apos;s only belie@@ vable enough that if somebody &apos;s just belie@@ vable enough that if somebody &apos;s just belie@@ vable enough for a few time , for a few time , for several time , for a few time , for a few time , i &apos;m going to be possible for a lot of time for several time , for a lot of time , i think , for some time , for several time , for a few time , for a few time , for a few time , for a few time , i think , for some time , for a few time , for several time , for a few time , for a few time , for a few time , i think
3018 G= since some of the time , i &apos;m interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo@@ -@@ effect . it seems strange that a ma@@ gi@@ er interested in it , it &apos;s because , you look at it as &quot; a de@@ ception , which is a de@@ ception , which is a de@@ ception , if somebody is just soli@@ d enough to it . &quot;
4230 T= we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dan@@ cers -- the Ã©@@ toi@@ le at me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan in new york and la sc@@ ala in mil@@ an -- and actually cap@@ tured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for fl@@ y@@ fire .
4230 H= we worked with ber@@ mali@@ to bol@@ l , working a best bal@@ cha@@ cer dan@@ cer of our time -- the curr@@ ons of tro@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater in new york and sc@@ roll sc@@ ala in mas@@ il@@ and -- -- we recor@@ ded its movements in 3d for use for the flu@@ y@@ a .

5296 T= but i do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the mal@@ a@@ y@@ si@@ an coast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
5296 H= but i remember the lights of the oil platform from the mal@@ a@@ y@@ a coast of the mal@@ a@@ y@@ dy@@ coast coast , and boys who broke down the journey was too much for him , and the fla@@ vor of the first apple apple , gave me one of the men on the platform .
5296 G= but i remember the lights of the oil platform from the mal@@ a@@ y@@ si@@ c coast , and at the young man , who broke and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the fla@@ ck of the first apple , and on the fla@@ ck of the first ap@@ f@@ els , which gave me one of the men on the platform .
5654 T= well the answer is , if i dre@@ w it on a normal cur@@ ve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
5654 H= because of that is , if i draw draw draw on a standard cur@@ ve , where saying , say that these years are , so the few ch@@ ch@@ se of a kind , and this is one favorite degree of technology that i want to visu@@ alize with a graph , then the graph becomes sil@@ ly .
5654 G= the reason it is , if i put it on a normal cur@@ ve , where , say , say , these are the years , the line cell , so the line of a way , and this is one of the technology that i want to describe with a graph graph , it &apos;s the graph .
6015 T= and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , you give talks , you make spee@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terror@@ ism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
6015 H= and these older people come to me now , and say , &quot; go@@ sh , conven@@ i@@ son , they talk talk ; they say people saying to stop saying that for our first time in history of terror@@ ism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
6015 G= these older people are coming to me and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , they &apos;re talking to them . they tell people that they should stop to say that they should stop the first time in the history of our nation with terror@@ ism : after september 11 . &quot;
6432 T= over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , isol@@ ated , not feeling the healthy kind of sh@@ ame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
6432 H= i took the next week that i made my taste for the first time the un@@ healthy sh@@ ots exists in our medical culture -- -- i felt myself alone , insu@@ ses the kind of healthy sh@@ ame you can &apos;t speak the kind of healthy sh@@ ame you can &apos;t speak with the colleagues that you can &apos;t speak with workers because you can &apos;t speak with the colleagues that you can &apos;t speak with the colleagues that you can promise because you can &apos;t speak with the colleagues for the next week , i made my taste for the first time , i made my taste for the first time , the next week i kept reading the un@@ healthy sh@@ ots that exist in our medical culture -- -- i felt myself isol@@ ated for the first time the un@@ healthy sh@@ ots in our medical culture -- -- i felt insu@@ lo@@ cated for the first time the lun@@ healthy dogs living in our medical culture -- -- i felt , alone , for the very first time the un@@ healthy dogs living in our medical culture -- i felt myself , the next week
6432 G= the next weeks , i made myself forward , and i went to the first time itself tou@@ ched the un@@ healthy sound that exists in our medical culture -- i felt isol@@ ated alone , isol@@ ated alone , isol@@ ated , not the way of healthy sch@@ am , who you feel , because you &apos;re not talking with the collea@@ gue .
4050 T= so whereas the fa@@ thers were extremely atten@@ tive to fig@@ uring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we inje@@ cted more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
4050 H= so where the green@@ aci@@ ers fa@@ thers were been investi@@ g@@ ated fig@@ ures like individuals prote@@ prote@@ cted from prote@@ cted state , it is possible that when we laugh@@ ed more mothers in this concept m@@ um , not just how you protect not just how you protect not just how you protect themselves .
4050 G= so where the fo@@ unding v@@ equ@@ ters were extremely extremely concerned about how individuals were prote@@ cted in the state , it &apos;s possible that if we need to bring more mothers in this concept , we would need a concept of be@@ bo@@ und , not just how you sha@@ ked , not just how to be prote@@ cted , but how we care for each .
3939 T= in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
3939 H= now we know now that sexual is complex enough is that we need to allow us to give us that nature doesn &apos;t exist among us between male and far@@ ming and cultural sex@@ ually and cultural sex@@ ually and cultural sex@@ ually and social sex@@ ually ; daily , we are we giving the line of waves as natural as natural .
3939 G= we know that gender is complicated enough , that sex@@ ually complicated enough is that we need to ad@@ mit that the nature of not line between male and soft , or between male and the inter@@ sexual and the inter@@ sexual and the inter@@ sexual and the inter@@ sexual and the inter@@ sexual and more of course .
6304 T= and they will get heal@@ thi@@ er by using the tri@@ cor@@ der , and they &apos;ll become better educ@@ ated by using the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by literally being able to use 3d prin@@ ting and infin@@ ite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
6304 H= and they become imple@@ mented by use use of produ@@ co@@ der health use , and they become better trained by han@@ king acade@@ mic acade@@ mic acade@@ mic , and by doing that they will have received 3@@ d-@@ prin@@ ter , &quot; and so much more productive , &quot; and so much more productive , and so much more productive than ever before .
6304 G= and you &apos;re heal@@ thi@@ er by using the use of the tri@@ co@@ der , and they &apos;re better trained by the k@@ han@@ -@@ active ac@@ a@@ dem@@ y , and by making that you &apos;re going to have the opportunity , 3d prin@@ ter and &quot; a source of computing , and so much productive than ever before .
5518 T= here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fir@@ es when he &apos;s covered in four feet of s@@ now .
5518 H= and here it looks from , looking after he see@@ king after a date , but what he really see@@ ds is somebody le@@ tting him absor@@ bed when he &apos;s in-@@ law , because he knows he &apos;s not really good in the burn fighting if he &apos;s covered by one meter s@@ now , if he &apos;s covered by one meter s@@ now .
5518 G= this is what it looks like , when he search for a date , but what he really addi@@ cted , is someone who grab@@ ul@@ ates him , when he sh@@ ins , he &apos;s not very good in the br@@ and@@ be@@ an-@@ fighting if he &apos;s covered in a meter .
5106 T= the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ na@@ is@@ es , mu@@ star@@ ds , vin@@ eg@@ ars , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contra@@ sting and actually pi@@ cking from that stun@@ ning display .
5106 H= the key reason for is that perhaps we eat enjoy us seeing these giant shel@@ ves of may@@ on@@ a@@ ors , mu@@ star@@ d , mu@@ star@@ d , mu@@ star@@ d and mel@@ t@@ lage , but we cannot attra@@ ct the repe@@ ti@@ able and boundar@@ y dis@@ sett@@ ling and able to actually choose some of the fab@@ ul@@ ous service off@@ ers .
5106 G= the main reason for this is that we might enjoy this huge rain@@ ale full of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , sen@@ f , essi@@ ve , essi@@ ve , essi@@ ve and mar@@ mel@@ ade , but we don &apos;t have the ver@@ tical and ab@@ bor@@ ro@@ tions , and then actually choose something out of the fantastic bot .

3206 G= well , i may be a little bit extremely extreme , you know , in this , how little appe@@ ti@@ te of memor@@ ies , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why give you a real question . why don &apos;t we spend that much weight in the lost mind that we spend ?
3201 T= and when i think about that , i think about a vac@@ ation we had in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other vac@@ ations .

913 T= those are it has a more ar@@ ty character , so it &apos;s many artists and philosop@@ her@@ s are working , together with scientists , on exam@@ ining these technologies and asking questions and process@@ ing the knowledge crea@@ tively , there are museum exhi@@ bi@@ tions and , well , all sorts of things .

1160 H= dead transpar@@ ency that think about the new think about what the new think about what the old sounds butt@@ on , seas@@ g , don &apos;t necessarily say that in las@@ ag@@ ne horse meat meat and no bee@@ ji@@ meat , nam@@ ely i want that just process@@ ing and wants to do this just simply process@@ ing and wants to do that .
1160 G= with the tot@@ al transpar@@ ence , which is the new thinking , which is the old thinking , sa@@ g yeah not saying that in las@@ ag@@ ne horse de@@ meat and no bee@@ f meat , which is , which is just the right ver@@ te@@ en , which is what i want to do right now .
1372 T= and when you see how far re@@ moved we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why offen@@ b@@ ach , for example , has a program to be climate neu@@ tra@@ l by tw@@ ent@@ y for@@ ty , right ?
1372 H= so where do we see how far we are away from what we really wanted to reach and could , and like sad we are , at least on earth are you able to see that for example open@@ stream needs a program to help 20 40 , you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see how far we &apos;re going to see how far we are going to be like far away from what we really wanted to reach out of what we really wanted to reach out , what do we really want to reach out what we really wanted to reach out what we really wanted to reach out what we really wanted to reach out of what we really wanted to reach out what we really wanted to reach out , what do we really want to reach out what we really wanted to reach out what we really wanted to reach out of how far we are
1372 G= and you see how far we &apos;re away from it , which we really wanted and could , and how sad we are at all on the earth , you can see that for example of the earth , you can see that , for example , you have a program , until tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ four quar@@ ter wants to be here , yes ?
2346 T= and you know , that curi@@ osity also mani@@ fest@@ ed itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the wo@@ ods , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; -- fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscop@@ e .

2438 T= and it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures that i can imagine , as a science fi@@ ction fan .
2438 H= and perhaps a small view looking at what perhaps happen in several decades , if you has bor@@ bor@@ g-@@ g-@@ body to study something or other things in all possible post-@@ human@@ -@@ liter@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ os i imag@@ ined as sci@@ atri@@ c c@@ tion@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ os i imag@@ ined as a sci@@ -@@ fi c@@ tion@@ -@@ friend@@ -@@ friend@@ -@@ c@@ tion@@ -@@ friend@@ -@@ friend@@ -@@ c@@ tion@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ os i could imag@@ ined as a sci@@ -@@ fi@@ ction of what might happen in some decades of human@@ -@@ liter@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ o

2502 T= if you sum up the co2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect effects , in that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these ra@@ pid changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
2502 H= they consu@@ me co2 that lead ris@@ ing co2 which lead rise to temperature incre@@ ases and increase these temperature incre@@ ases has consequences has consequences a few very positive effects , effects effects , the indi@@ rec@@ alization sequence that the natural ecosystem can cannot ada@@ pt and fall together all kinds of systems can not ada@@ pt and fall all systems together and collapse all systems together .

3296 T= so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intui@@ tive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , o@@ bes@@ ity , i believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .

2836 T= we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we bat@@ t@@ led progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
2836 H= we &apos;re on th@@ res@@ hold on the th@@ res@@ hold , ast@@ on@@ ishing events in many fields , and yet i really really think hundreds of years before trying to address time to find a time where we have progress in development where we have progress in which we &apos;ve done progress in which we have done over these things le@@ f@@ ter , on more fron@@ tal than right now .

6275 G= and from a conversation today , with de@@ an ka@@ man , one of the inno@@ v@@ ors of the do it , wants to share with you -- he gave per@@ mission -- his engineering shot , &quot; sl@@ ing@@ shot , &quot; the sl@@ ing@@ shot , &quot; and many of many of you may have heard . it has the size of a cool@@ -@@ ran@@ ks in the students .
6485 T= if i were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cra@@ ck a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
6485 H= now , when i spend a room full colleagues and requ@@ est support support for support support and find them telling them what i &apos;ve just told you about what i &apos;ve just told you would not achieve the end of second story before they really wouldn &apos;t be able to achieve any jo@@ ke , anyone would would change a jo@@ ke , they would change the theme and forget the rest .
6485 G= if i live in a room full of with collea@@ gue , and to ask their so@@ sal assi@@ stance and ask them to tell you , what i told you , i would really probably not likely to reach the end of the second story , before it would introduce you to really un@@ pleas@@ ant dig@@ nity , they would make the issue and forget the rest .
427 T= but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
427 H= but instead we wanted , we wanted to do much further , but we wanted build building a whole range of bacteri@@ um sound genetic code -- so we thought we built it into ta@@ pes from the scale of the size of the virus of the virus of the size of the c@@ asse@@ ts of the size of the ta@@ pe function of a living cell cells .
427 G= but what we were trying to do is we wanted to build a total of bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some . it has more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters gene@@ tics . so we thought we &apos;re building it in k@@ asse@@ ts of the size of the virus that we could vari@@ ate the size of the virus that we &apos;re able to understand what the individual components are a living cell .
1418 T= the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate bi@@ og@@ as , on one he@@ ct@@ are of land with five thousand in@@ habit@@ ants in the fa@@ vel@@ as , a far@@ mer can ear@@ n about one thousand five hundred dollars and main@@ tain the p@@ lot with it , raise chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s and du@@ cks and grow vege@@ tables and farm fish .
1418 H= now , this is actually beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture power , bio@@ chem@@ as , produced on a le@@ ar ar country with five part@@ ners part@@ ners in vel@@ vel@@ as , can build a far@@ mer about low-@@ cost levels and the condi@@ tion@@ ers waiting and pig@@ s and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tures and vege@@ tures and vege@@ tures and vege@@ se and vege@@ se and vege@@ se and vege@@ se and vege@@ se and fish and vege@@ tures and fish and vege@@ tures and fish and vege@@ tures and fish and vege@@ tures and fish and vege@@ tables and fish and vege@@ tables and fish and vege@@ tures and fish and vege@@ tables and vege@@ fish and vege@@ tures and fish and vege@@ tures and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tures and fish and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tures and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ fish and vege@@ se and vege@@ se and vege@@ tables and vege@@ fish and
1418 G= what &apos;s actually beautiful is if you do that , well , agriculture does , bi@@ og@@ as gener@@ ates on a he@@ ct@@ ar country with fif@@ th in fa@@ vel@@ as , there is a far@@ er about one-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -@@ 100 dollars , and the plant so wait , chi@@ ck@@ ers and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and wh@@ ales and vege@@ tables and wh@@ ales and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and wh@@ ales and vege@@ tables .
0 T= you know , one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ gst those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by rain , taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
0 H= you know , one of the big bur@@ den travel travel traveling traveling traveling traveling traveling traveling in the eth@@ no@@ graphi@@ cal research , together living people who remember still remember the old days that your past still feel still in the wind still feeling still in the wind , they bu@@ ried on the white by@@ bers of plants bu@@ cks plants bu@@ cks plants bu@@ cks the plants .
0 G= you know , one of the great practic@@ es , and one of the most deli@@ gh@@ ted at the eth@@ no@@ graph@@ ic research is , in common with the people , who can remember the old days , you can gl@@ u@@ late on the rain , they gl@@ ori@@ zed in the rain , gl@@ ori@@ ously gl@@ ori@@ zed st@@ ones of the plants .
624 T= you know , i think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the ves@@ sel , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ know@@ able , e@@ ternal myster@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsibility to put on one fra@@ gi@@ le , human psy@@ che .
624 H= do you know ? i think one na@@ ked person thinks he thinks he or whether it &apos;s like small@@ po@@ x , like small@@ po@@ x and food waste and sources of di@@ di@@ cular , crea@@ tives , infin@@ ite myster@@ i@@ um , unfortunately , infin@@ ite myster@@ i@@ um is a tiny too much responsibility to bur@@ den you a questi@@ oned , human psy@@ che of human psychology to bur@@ den .
624 G= you know ? i think , a m@@ ere person , that he thinks , or it &apos;s like the fa@@ x , and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ce of all go@@ tt@@ able , creative , un@@ known , un@@ known myster@@ i@@ ums is a small bit of a fra@@ gi@@ le , human psy@@ che .
2065 T= and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his states , and that i would ru@@ in his relationship with the vio@@ lin if i started talking about sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vio@@ lin pe@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ y .
2065 H= and i didn &apos;t mean , not mine , but i fear fear that i could lose lose fall@@ ing in one of his conditions , and that i could destro@@ y him to destro@@ y his relationship to vul@@ ge , when i started talking about tons of tons and poor gu@@ ests and other exciting forms of di@@ vin@@ ish@@ a and other exciting forms of di@@ e@@ pe@@ e@@ e@@ pe@@ e@@ go@@ d@@ po@@ k . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;

2701 T= but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
2701 H= but what my dream here is is that if you can make it economic , and simul@@ tane@@ ously dis@@ placed co2 , then say co2 says , &quot; all , it doesn &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t lose co2 , i wi@@ shed almost almost that it could accept , but i &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheap , because it &apos;s cheap than the previous method . &quot;
2701 G= but my dream here is that if you embra@@ ced it economic , and at the same time we elimin@@ ate it , then say the skep@@ tics say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not interested in that it doesn &apos;t em@@ it@@ ted , i almost wish that it &apos;s the val@@ te , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheap than the previous method . &quot;
3191 T= it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies with two different surge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that choo@@ ses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be cho@@ sen .
3191 H= now , it &apos;s actually the one that choices choices , because if you have a patient who , who said , two repres@@ ent@@ ations between two different surgery surge@@ ons surge@@ ons , choo@@ choose choo@@ sing choo@@ sing choo@@ sing that has dec@@ ele@@ cted that has lost less terrible , and that &apos;s sur@@ gical , who have fewer terrible , and that &apos;s sur@@ gical , who cho@@ sen will be cho@@ sen .
3191 G= it &apos;s actually the reason that decisions app@@ lies , because if you have a patient , who , say two different visi@@ ons , two different surgeon ga@@ ins and deci@@ ding what choo@@ ses , the choo@@ sing choo@@ ses , the choo@@ sing of the reme@@ dy who has reme@@ m@@ bers the reme@@ dy of reme@@ dy , who is sel@@ ec@@ ted .
5571 T= if you should ever have the chance to staf@@ f your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an o@@ pos@@ sum stuck in your house .
5571 H= ever when you ever have the chance to work in your urban art center , like our fellow scot@@ scot@@ t center , how our fellow scot@@ scot@@ ts slo@@ wed sil@@ ently than part of the code -- indeed -- will you see that people calling the government for creative problems , including inclu@@ sive issues , including a ben@@ tel@@ rat@@ rat in your house .
5571 G= if you &apos;ve ever given the chance , in d@@ one urban call@@ -@@ center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver sil@@ ver@@ man as part of the program -- in fact , they do all the -- you &apos;ll see that the people , the government because of a variety of different problems , including , including a th@@ yl@@ als in your house .
6433 T= you know that healthy kind , when you betra@@ y a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve@@ al and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you and you have terrible discus@@ sions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gui@@ des you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
6433 H= they all know the healthy sh@@ ots , when you gives one myster@@ y of the price of free friend &apos;s prize , although this one on wa@@ ther@@ -@@ law swa@@ swa@@ p and then the best friend you face a terrible discussion when a terrible debate leading , and my one terrible discussion leading though the terrible talent lead and you swa@@ p , although you have a such mista@@ kes that you have never power a mistake again .
6433 G= you all know the heal@@ ing scre@@ am , if you give a secret secret of the best fre@@ ir@@ on of the price , even though that one of the disappe@@ ars , and the best friend has pres@@ ented with it and leads to a terrible argument , if one am the end though it leads to the end , that you make one such a mistake .
101 T= well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed for its wars or its technological innova@@ tions , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either ac@@ tively end@@ or@@ sed or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
101 H= now , fact , fact , is that you remember the 20 century , in $ 300 years , not re@@ reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed , but more than an era we were against were and massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the earth either activ@@ ated or passi@@ vely accep@@ table or passi@@ vely accep@@ table or passi@@ vely accep@@ table or passi@@ vely accep@@ table , so that problem is not change .
101 G= so , the fact is that you &apos;re going to be in 300 years , not for his wars or technological innova@@ tions , but rather than an an era , in which we train against , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity in the earth are either active suppor@@ tive of the biological and cultural diversity in either of the earth . so that problem isn &apos;t the shift .
699 T= curious histor@@ ical foot@@ note -- when the mo@@ ors inv@@ aded southern spa@@ in , they took this cu@@ sto@@ m with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries from &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; o@@ le , o@@ le , o@@ le , &quot; which you still hear in bu@@ ll@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ en@@ co dan@@ ces .

1908 T= i probably bel@@ ong , are those two friend@@ ly girls still here , i probably bel@@ ong to the generation that created this bad e@@ col@@ o@@ gical image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en se@@ vent@@ y nine , i think it &apos;s called k@@ it today .
1908 H= now i say re , these are the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably listening to generation who orche@@ strated for this terrible micro@@ ko image , because i &apos;ve nin@@ 10,000 thousand nin@@ nin@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ 0s already starting construction construction in kar@@ l@@ s@@ wand@@ a , tech high school today called engineering high school today , i believe , k@@ it@@ te .
1908 G= i probably heard , are the two nin@@ et@@ y-@@ girls , i probably heard about the generation of the generation that has taken for this bad o@@ ko image , because i ne@@ un@@ tens of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundre@@ d-@@ ne@@ un@@ si@@ vely , technical high school , today , i think , k@@ it .
2395 T= so , i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with reali@@ stic human emo@@ tive characters gener@@ ated in c@@ g , and the main characters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g .
2395 H= i had had written this piece &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; written the lat@@ lat@@ ine effects effects effects effects effects effects effec@@ ti@@ als effects effects in entirely new woo@@ den effects , cop@@ i@@ stic human , cop@@ i@@ stic characteri@@ stics that had been produced by c@@ g , and major characters should all be g . and the major characters should all be g . and the main world should be c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g , and the world should be c@@ g , and the world should be c@@ g and computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated effects effects effects effects effects effects effec@@ ti@@ les in stuff of visual effects effects and computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects effects
2395 G= i had written this piece &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; this piece &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; and computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated effects in quite new hei@@ ghts , with reali@@ stic human , expres@@ sive human , expres@@ sed characters that were designed c@@ g . and the main fig@@ ures should be syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed . and the world should be c@@ g .
3129 T= now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a questi@@ on-@@ and-@@ answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound .
3129 H= now , i &apos;d like to talk about someone who had ans@@ wer@@ ed a questi@@ on@@ g-@@ and-@@ t-@@ z lap@@ ession after a lec@@ tures a narra@@ tive who told a story -- &#91; un@@ clear ... &#93; he had heard an sin@@ cer music , absolutely absolutely rul@@ ers , absolutely absolutely rul@@ ers , and all the end of recor@@ ding the sound of sound .
3129 G= well , i &apos;d like to talk with one example of someone who had a fra@@ ge-@@ und@@ -@@ answer si@@ tion after one of my pre-@@ read@@ ings , who recor@@ ded a story . &#91; un@@ clear &#93; -- &#93; he said , he would bel@@ on@@ g@@ ony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and at the end of the shot there .
4119 T= now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensor@@ s colle@@ cting information from the car , trans@@ mit@@ ting this information into the system , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is colle@@ cted .
4119 H= now today , take you want to win , if wan@@ ting an race , actually want to gain something like this -- something which car has trans@@ wash@@ ed over a few thousand sensor@@ s that give information information information , spending information on the car , spending information on the system , and then use these information to send back and share things in real shift during information throughout information and become different information throughout information throughout information and become different information throughout information and become different information in real time .
4119 G= now , today , you need , if you want to win a race , in actually monit@@ or something like this here -- something that wa@@ kes in real time , a thousand sensor@@ s , the information from the car , on this information and apply it to this car and putting it into this car and colle@@ cting things in real time and colle@@ cting things in real time and colle@@ cting things in real time .
5144 T= so a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o previ@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan .
5144 H= now , in a study that i &apos;ve done with sing@@ apo@@ o-@@ gas@@ o-@@ gas and ni@@ din@@ and@@ smo@@ o ter@@ ter@@ o 193@@ 0@@ 0@@ o &apos;@@ ter@@ o , we &apos;ve made a study working at ing -- employees all worked for dinner -- all all for dinner -- and these people were all involved in a colle@@ ction where they participa@@ te their participa@@ tion supply for their reti@@ re@@ ment supply plans .
5144 G= so we &apos;ve done in a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o &apos;s ter@@ o , we &apos;ve made a study with the people at ing -- -- and these people were all emplo@@ yed in a colle@@ ction colle@@ ction in which they sig@@ ned their participa@@ tion for their reti@@ re@@ ment plan .
260 T= and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for decisi@@ on-@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
260 H= the result is -- we call it patient &apos;s patients &apos; patient , &quot; which sounds like one good thing , but reality is a shift responsible bur@@ st of responsibility responsible for somebody who white something -- nam@@ ely the doctor doctor -- nam@@ ely the doctor doctor -- somebody who isn &apos;t positive and highest ill ill is a decision to meet -- nam@@ ely the patient .
260 G= the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonom@@ y , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but reality is a shift of the choo@@ sing decisions of someone who knows -- nam@@ ely the do@@ tor -- nam@@ ely from the do@@ tor -- somebody who knows nothing and the highest ill is a decision -- nam@@ ely in the best const@@ it@@ ution is a decision -- nam@@ ely the patient .
612 T= they believed that a geni@@ us was this , sort of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like do@@ bby the house el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of invisi@@ bly as@@ s@@ ist the artist with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
612 H= she believed that an geni@@ us was cre@@ ature this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ vin@@ ity cre@@ ature being believed that liter@@ liter@@ literally living wine living living living in the walls living artist -- about such such as do@@ ast , the house@@ 11 -- the ki@@ ck and the artist in work , and the artist in work , and the result of work would become invisi@@ ble and result result the result of work would become possible .
612 G= they believed that a geni@@ us believed that a geni@@ us of this kind of ma@@ gical go@@ tt@@ able creatures , that literally in the w@@ fe@@ es of an artist at@@ eli@@ ers -- about as do@@ bby , the house of the house -- the out@@ come -- the out of the work , and the artist in the work was in the work , and the result of the work .
678 T= this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of p@@ its of des@@ pair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
678 H= and this idea rec@@ t@@ ited as i right in the ty@@ process process , practice , practice , mathemati@@ y , wes@@ y , and i fell into a cli@@ va@@ station of dou@@ f@@ rock that we all fall when we work working on something and not work . you start thinking that it becomes disaster . the most worst book ever been written in . that &apos;s ever written .
678 G= this idea , when i was in the middle of the des@@ cen@@ ding process of , pra@@ y , pra@@ y , love . i fell in one of these gr@@ u@@ bes of the two rock els in which we all drop , if we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start to think that it becomes a des@@ aster . that &apos;s the worst book that has been written .
1996 T= we also brought one of these dies@@ el ag@@ gre@@ gates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the dies@@ el is behind it , here &apos;s the big battery , here are all the conver@@ ters , with which we simu@@ late the network .
1996 H= now , we also have one of this dies@@ -@@ agen@@ cy center in the same scale as he stands up in half , actually brought the full dynamic behavior from this network , so hal@@ mp now looks like this from the able here now the big battery here standing here the big battery here , here the big battery here , here are the big battery here who we network the web simulation .
1996 G= we also have one of these the same ag@@ gre@@ gate in the same size , which he put there , in the hall , in fact , in the hall , so in the hall , so in the back here , there is this back here , there &apos;s the big bat@@ ter@@ y , here &apos;s the great bat@@ ter@@ y , here &apos;s the big bat@@ ter@@ y , which we simul@@ late the network .
2284 T= if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
2284 H= so if i want to take you one thing about is that the total ness of data we consu@@ me , bigger than consu@@ mer@@ cing its pieces and instead thinking about information process@@ charge charge i want you to think about how we can use information as we can use information as we can use information so that patterns can dete@@ ct patterns that otherwise wouldn &apos;t become prob@@ able than otherwise .
2284 G= if i want to give you one thing today is that the colle@@ ction of the data that we consu@@ me , greater than the sum of their individual parts and instead of over@@ load of information over@@ load , and instead of thinking about information as we use information so we can use information so we can use information so that the pattern that would otherwise become visible .
3940 T= so what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science goes , the more we have to ad@@ mit to ourselves that these categ@@ ories that we thought of as stable an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that ma@@ pped very simply to stable identity categ@@ ories are a lot more fu@@ zz@@ y than we thought .
3940 H= so , we have so one position where , ever our continu@@ ed continu@@ es , we have to stand up so more interven@@ tion that these categ@@ ories that had given highly low-@@ or@@ der@@ ments that had kept very simple satis@@ fac@@ ul@@ ations establi@@ sh@@ ments to create perman@@ ently er@@ able daily daily daily activity sc@@ at@@ er@@ er@@ aries , are far ob@@ sc@@ ul@@ ers than we have adop@@ ted , much ob@@ sc@@ ul@@ ers than we have adop@@ ted .
3940 G= so , we have so a situation where , depen@@ ding on our science , and we have to deal with more and more , that these categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve given for stable an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories , which were very simple ingre@@ di@@ ents , which are very simple ingre@@ di@@ ents in const@@ ant iden@@ tical identi@@ ties , when we suppose .
15 T= no bi@@ ologists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ario in the real@@ m of biological diversity -- sc@@ arc@@ ely approach@@ es what we know to be the most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ario in the real@@ m of cultural diversity .
