4369 T= and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
4369 H= and that question , what would everyone ask you to ask each day every single day every single day every single day every single day , which is it ? if not me when i don &apos;t know who ? and when not me who ?
4369 G= and this question , everybody should imagine each of you and that every single day , which gives you something that does have done . if not now , when you do ? and if not i , if you ?
4488 T= so we extra@@ cted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in two digital bom@@ bs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
4488 H= and so we extra@@ cted the attac@@ ks code and found out the attac@@ it@@ cen@@ s@@ code code and found out that it &apos;s been virtu@@ ally wired up in two digital heads minds -- a smaller and bigger one larger .
4488 G= so extra@@ hi@@ red and de@@ com@@ pi@@ ated , and de@@ com@@ pi@@ ated the ang@@ ri@@ ff@@ s@@ - code , and what turns out that he cle@@ an@@ ed up in two digital heads , a smaller and a larger .
3946 T= and as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where we have to ac@@ knowledge that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories we &apos;ve had are probably over@@ ly simpli@@ stic .
3946 H= while we continue to push our science over our days , we &apos;re increasingly going to be increasingly im@@ per@@ ative , where we have to see that the experiments categ@@ ory categ@@ ories that we have probably gener@@ ali@@ too sim@@ le .

3966 T= so as you all rec@@ all , what our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were re@@ je@@ cting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
3966 H= as you all remember , emp@@ ires our fa@@ ther@@ -@@ fa@@ thers the notion of mon@@ arch@@ ia , and mon@@ arch@@ ie based based based on a very simpli@@ fied concept of atoms in a very simpli@@ fied concept of atoms from atoms .

407 T= so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
407 H= therefore we &apos;ve determin@@ ed us is that the single way forward is actually to syn@@ thetic what allows us allows us to syn@@ thes@@ ize what allows us to allo@@ cate and allo@@ wing some of these fundament@@ als ask some of these fundamental questions .
407 G= so we decided we decided that it was the only way forward to this chromo@@ some , actually syn@@ thes@@ ize what allows us to version the individual components and so some of these fundamental questions .
1361 T= and if you den@@ y people the if you den@@ y people their existence , if you say , it would be better if you weren &apos;t here at all , people become grab@@ by and ho@@ sti@@ le .

1195 T= the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn &apos;t at all , they &apos;re actually equ@@ ally big , and yet our perception changes , depen@@ ding on the context we place things in .
1195 H= the right end looks looks bigger than the small , although this is not the case , but it &apos;s just the same size , and still changes our perception that we define when context in which context we put things in which context we put things in which context we put things in place in which context we make things in which context .
1195 G= the rights circle looks larger than the little , even though that &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s just a very big , and yet , our perception change , depen@@ ding on what context we find .
1251 T= of course designers don &apos;t only look at the top@@ ic of per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral processes or cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , but pri@@ mar@@ ily at the top@@ ic of the relationship between man and object of course .
1251 H= of course , the switch switch is not just dealing with the subject of perception and neu@@ ral process@@ om@@ om@@ ia , but pri@@ mi@@ r of course , but pri@@ macy with the subject of the human object .
1251 G= of course , the st@@ ages are not just per@@ pe@@ tual with the issue , and neu@@ ral process@@ ing or cognitive com@@ passionate , but pri@@ mar@@ ily of course with the subject of human objects .
1282 T= if they become more intui@@ tive and then i have to rough@@ -@@ hand@@ le my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , when is something really intui@@ tive ?
1282 H= now , when you become more intui@@ tive , and then i have to switch back my little friend here and check what does that mean , cognitive g@@ aller@@ om@@ ia , when is now something intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively ?
1282 G= if you &apos;re more intui@@ tive , and then i &apos;ve got my little friend here , and gu@@ x , which does that mean , just from the point of cogni@@ tional gon@@ om@@ om@@ y , when &apos;s really something even intui@@ tive ?
1294 T= o@@ sit in itself is used by us fif@@ ty to se@@ vent@@ y thousand times depen@@ ding on the activity , it was as@@ cer@@ ta@@ ined that when you sleep it is stra@@ ined less than in the day .
1294 H= and o@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ce is become appro@@ ved until seven or seven thousand times a year of activity ever after activity , so in the sleep , you determin@@ ed it less frequ@@ ently than noon .
1294 G= o@@ bes@@ o@@ de@@ an , about fif@@ ty to se@@ b@@ ci@@ g@@ a thousand times , which is in the sleep , so in the sleep , that there is less often stra@@ cted as a day .
1023 T= we all know that inter@@ active media is , by definition , non-@@ lin@@ ear , which invol@@ ves the ne@@ gation of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and which of course tells us that we consider lin@@ ear@@ ity normal today .
1023 H= we all know that the inter@@ active media are percei@@ ved by definition of definition of non-@@ lin@@ ear , which inclu@@ des vern@@ ess of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and of course what us of course says is that we feel the lin@@ ear@@ ity than normally today .

2969 T= now we can do it in a more pre@@ cise way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vi@@ tam@@ in a into ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
2969 H= we can now do it . and obviously it &apos;s risk . and of course it &apos;s risk . but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a ri@@ ce , and that can help millions people , millions of people living her life too .
2969 G= now , we can make it more clo@@ sely , and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a ri@@ ce , and the stuff can help millions of people , their lives .
1820 T= and when this breath of air po@@ urs out onto a human , the human is filled with dig@@ nity , with mind , with nature that can only live with a sou@@ l .
1820 H= and of that sou@@ l , you &apos;re now thinking that it &apos;s sort of kind of nature in this clou@@ dy nature , anim@@ a is called it in the lat@@ ent@@ an , the wal@@ lo@@ tun@@ a , the wal@@ lo@@ tun@@ a , pra@@ ir@@ y .

2534 T= through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
2534 H= because of all of its fail@@ ures in the field sector , through other ex@@ tot@@ yp@@ es , building new metho@@ d@@ ways , there are a lot of services , whose source of energy can allow some individual services to 90 percent of them to reduce 90 percent .
2534 G= because of all different success@@ ors in the light sector , by other au@@ tot@@ yp@@ es , through new metho@@ ds , there are many services , their energy process@@ ing some individual services .
2655 T= once you get the first one built , if it works as adverti@@ sed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy den@@ sity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
2655 H= once the first finish is when it is walking as usual as fail@@ ures , then it &apos;s all obvious because the fun@@ er@@ ness of energy is such as different as nuclear energy as we know you .
2655 G= as soon as the first done is , if it &apos;s going on , it &apos;s all quite clear , because the economic power , the power of energy , the power of energy , as we know it .
2706 T= unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just fund@@ ing the learning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
2706 H= it &apos;s because , you know , it &apos;s very short before a cost break@@ through and fin@@ ance fin@@ ds just the student cur@@ ve -- i believe we should have attemp@@ t more things that have potential to be very much che@@ aper .
2706 G= it &apos;s because , you &apos;re very shor@@ tly before a free break@@ down and fund@@ ed only even the learning cur@@ ve , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential , very much g@@ lies .
6616 T= and if you think about &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think of why people were so tou@@ ched by it -- never mind the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so tou@@ ched by the ima@@ gery ?
6616 H= when you think of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; is , when you think about why humans were tou@@ ched — bes@@ i@@ des the po@@ ca h@@ ca history , why were you so touch from the ima@@ ge-@@ world ?

3955 T= and as a consequ@@ ence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categ@@ ories as we &apos;ve had before .
3955 H= and as a result , we begin to deal with the really difficult question , when someone is being dead , and this brings us in a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have categ@@ ory theor@@ ies like earlier .
3955 G= and as a result , we shif@@ ted ourselves with the fight with the really difficult question , when somebody dead is dead , and that brings ourselves into a really difficult position , in which we don &apos;t have more so simple categ@@ ories than earlier .
4013 T= so for example , texas has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a y chromo@@ some , and what it means to mar@@ ry a woman means you do have a y chromo@@ some .

1171 T= against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps for@@ gotten , and what is instin@@ ctive for us , so what difference does it make ?
1171 H= so before the background , i started looking at what is that , because what is it , because what is natural for us , of course , what do we also have lost , whatever is the difference ?
1171 G= so before the background , i &apos;ve embar@@ ked too bus@@ y , which is what it &apos;s actually , which is , of course , which is , maybe even lost , but also instin@@ c@@ tively , so what makes the difference ?
3590 T= and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h-@@ and-@@ bone legs , i wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .

3058 G= but if you look at the shape , in which you give the plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , in a smaller p@@ le , and these blue b@@ ars and a book of letters pre@@ gene , it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ able effective .
3123 T= i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-@@ being is .

3123 G= i think there &apos;s a certain meaning to which we could con@@ tain it , but in the great and all this is something that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to embra@@ ce the complicated visible way , which is good .

3537 T= there is ad@@ ver@@ sity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ ver@@ sity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
3537 H= there &apos;s the lives of vi@@ third skills and challenge , and those are just becoming sound and every person deal with it differently , but the question is not whether we arri@@ ve with thir@@ third skills or not , but as we get clear to it or not , but as we get clear to it .
3537 G= there &apos;s wi@@ dri@@ ty and challenges in life and challenges , and that &apos;s just everyday , and every person is going to be different , but the question is not , though we come with wi@@ dri@@ ties right now , but how we come out with it .

4773 H= you en@@ ab@@ led us telling us the story of neuro@@ marketing , so as we use the story in this video video is that today uses mr@@ is to use the mag@@ ni@@ tude of the brain , to make commercial adverti@@ sing movies as also to make movies as also films .
4773 G= they en@@ able us to tell the story of the neuro@@ marketing , so how we used to tell the story in this film , that today is using mr@@ is , to p@@ ei@@ ling , both to make adverti@@ sing films as movies .
5088 T= now choo@@ sing not to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ i@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affec@@ ts us even in very consequ@@ enti@@ al decisions .
5088 H= now , not to buy a glass tag is probably good for us -- it &apos;s probably good for us -- it &apos;s good for our tac@@ ality -- but it turns out that the decisi@@ on-@@ making trans@@ lation decisi@@ on-@@ making decisions also affect us with very specific decisi@@ on-@@ making decisions .
5088 G= well , no glass mar@@ mel@@ ade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our ta@@ ille -- but it turns out that the decision of over@@ la@@ st@@ process problems .
6375 T= and i came out of medical school with the impres@@ sion that if i memor@@ i@@ zed everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would imm@@ uni@@ ze me against making mista@@ kes .
6375 H= and i spent the medical student studying the idea i knew if i knew anything i knew anything and knew anything , or at least as possible as near complete as near complete as near complete as near complete as near complete as near the way that i be imm@@ une to making the make of mista@@ kes .
6375 G= and i left the medical school , with the impres@@ sion that i knew if i knew everything , or at least as much as possible as possible , as close as possible , as close as possible , that i could im@@ mu@@ n against mista@@ kes .
2985 T= it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pro@@ sp@@ ering .
2985 H= it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the notion that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do not allow work to do your job because we fear have is really a complete g@@ g@@ g@@ g@@ ases , and it ends millions from humans off fl@@ our@@ ishing .
2985 G= it &apos;s a process , and sometimes sometimes it works and sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science , because we &apos;re sc@@ ared of a real s@@ ack@@ gas@@ sis , and it takes millions of people from the rise .
127 T= this is a photograph i took at the northern ti@@ p of ba@@ ff@@ in island when i went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some in@@ u@@ it people , and this man , ol@@ a@@ y@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .

1189 T= we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a conf@@ using way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &apos;t tell which one is s@@ alt and which one is pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can basically design them intui@@ tively , by showing things .
1189 H= so we see this here , when i shape things old , then i can shape it how on the right , where i don &apos;t know , what is alt and p@@ ill hits , or i can shape you intui@@ tively manipu@@ late it intui@@ tively by showing things like i &apos;m going to shape it intui@@ tively by showing things .
1189 G= we look at that , if i get things up , then i conf@@ using them conf@@ using how on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s sal@@ z and p@@ fe@@ ff@@ er , or i can make it sort of intui@@ tively designing things .
1230 T= that means i &apos;ve cor@@ rup@@ ted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this ob@@ sc@@ ure image .
1230 H= that means , i literally laugh@@ ed it right now , you know , i didn &apos;t see you see no pattern in it , but i di@@ tioned them over time , over time , over those dog in this ob@@ scen@@ ous image .
1230 G= that is , i &apos;ve actually seen it right now , that they don &apos;t realize no pattern in there , but i have con@@ di@@ tioned it , but i have con@@ di@@ tioned to this dog in this ver@@ meer picture .
710 T= this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the danger@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success .
710 H= and so i started thinking about this , and so with safety in the past months while i worked at the book , while i worked at the book that is soon when the dangerous , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , hop@@ e@@ tor@@ ing success of my un@@ experi@@ en@@ cing success of my un@@ experi@@ en@@ cing success .
710 G= so i started thinking , and so i think i worked with safety in the past months , while i was working on the book -- when the dangerous , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , very expected , inten@@ ded success@@ es .
891 T= i study molecular biology and have been doing research into bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more deta@@ iled knowledge and especially wanted to put what i &apos;d learned theore@@ tically into practice .
891 H= i student molecular biology biology and engagement i just work with the bio@@ ha@@ cked , and i started doing this , because i just wanted to know , because i just wanted to know and make it even even myself , what i learned in studying theore@@ tically , what i learned in studying theore@@ tically , what i learned in studying theore@@ tically .
891 G= i studied molecular biology , and i &apos;d just been involved in the study of the bio@@ ha@@ cking , and what i started , because i simply wanted to really understand , and it was particularly even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even more specifically , and what i &apos;d like to do in the study of theore@@ tical .
1133 T= i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curi@@ osity and how curi@@ osity in turn trans@@ forms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curi@@ osity and need to give it a j@@ ol@@ t et ce@@ ter@@ a .
1133 H= of course i &apos;m reti@@ red of house , so i &apos;m dealing with the subject of curi@@ osity and how trans@@ forms the curi@@ osity and how changes curi@@ osity again our thinking , and why lose why we may also lose curi@@ osity and we need to res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion and and so on .
1133 G= i &apos;m taken out of the house , so , of course , with the subject of curi@@ osity and how changing curi@@ osity and how changing the curi@@ er also , and why , maybe we &apos;re losing curi@@ osity and so on .
1174 T= and to see when something is intui@@ tive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friend@@ ly , so as intui@@ tive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
1174 H= and while , of course , is something intui@@ tively intui@@ tively , and how can i take as switch on and visu@@ ali@@ zing things such as shape that they require a user kind of user , so you can use intui@@ tively , so you can make fun and are just too .
1174 G= and when of course , of course something intui@@ tively , and how can i be an activ@@ ist on the things so that it &apos;s a user friend@@ ly , so you have a user mode , well , because they &apos;re fun and fun .
308 T= so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer op@@ tions to choose from .
308 H= so that &apos;s the effect that the other effect is is that self if we hit the paraly@@ embra@@ ce and choo@@ sing making making less satis@@ fied with the out@@ come of choice , as if we had the opportunity to choose less opportunities to decide between less opportunities .
308 G= so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end less happy with the out@@ comes of choice , when if we had the possibility of opportunity to decide .
2535 T= there are other services like how we make ferti@@ li@@ zer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
2535 H= in other others , like the resources of resource resources , 100,000 dollars : 0@@ 5 five : 0@@ 5 five : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6@@ 6@@ ,000 -- 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 five : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or air traffic , is the play@@ room for impro@@ vement is very much smaller .
2535 G= in other services , like the manufacturing of thin , 10@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or air traffic transport , is the game space for impro@@ v@@ ements is very much smaller .
1280 T= and if i go a step further in these natural user inter@@ faces , where i can control things via voice , speech , touch and gest@@ ure rather than a mouse and cur@@ sor , then i am even faster and more immedi@@ ate .
1280 H= and then when i continue to go further , where i go on , where i agree with voice , by language , by verb@@ al language , by verb@@ al language , by verb@@ al language and verb@@ sor control things , then i am still quick@@ er faster and even immedi@@ ate more middle and even immedi@@ acy .
1280 G= and if i continue one step further into this natural intern@@ al inter@@ faces , where i have per voice , per voice , per touch , per touch and not more per mouse and cur@@ sor that needs things , then i &apos;m going to have more and more un@@ medi@@ able .
1462 T= not burning the bio@@ soli@@ ds a little more , stor@@ ing them and losing all the materials for the cy@@ cles in the in@@ cin@@ er@@ ation plant , but asking on@@ es@@ el@@ f , how do you close cy@@ cles ?
1462 H= not losing the ligh@@ t@@ weight still burn a little bit better to burn him and losing it up and losing it all the materials for cir@@ cl@@ ing all the materials for cir@@ cles , but first time , how does you join r@@ é@@ s@@ zy@@ es ?
1462 G= not , the ligh@@ ter finally burn a little bit better and burn and burn it with it and put it with it and put it in the burning facili@@ ty , but first time , but let &apos;s first time , but first time , how close you can make a cycle run ?
2320 T= so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sci@@ ences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my bo@@ ss -- and one has come from music .
2320 H= now , when i know all of those individuals i know that the majority of govern@@ ance are govern@@ ance , some of some people come from science ; some , even less , come from economics . this is my head of music , and one comes out of the music sphere .
2320 G= so , if i look at all these people , recognize that the majority of this gover@@ n@@ man , some come from the science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my che@@ f . and one comes from the music section .
2345 T= and i was always absor@@ bed in a book , science fi@@ ction book , which took my mind to other worl@@ ds , and satis@@ fied , in a narra@@ tive form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of curi@@ osity that i had .
2345 H= and my nose always stuck in a book , a super@@ -@@ sci@@ -@@ fi c@@ tion@@ -@@ book that spar@@ ked my thoughts in other worl@@ ds and nar@@ r@@ ent@@ an way my deep@@ -@@ si@@ zed curi@@ osity wor@@ shi@@ el@@ ded curi@@ osity curi@@ osity pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful curi@@ osity .

3344 T= now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worl@@ ds .
3344 H= now , the issue of ko@@ surgery online like world of war@@ craft is that it is so satis@@ fying is that there is so satis@@ fying at standing at one ep@@ an im@@ an vic@@ tory of ep@@ an ep@@ an ter@@ restri@@ al vic@@ tory , our entire time spent our entire time in those to@@ worl@@ ed space .
3344 G= so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative online worl@@ ds as the world of waiting , that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying , any@@ time at the edge of a ep@@ ish se@@ gment , that we &apos;d rather spend our entire time in playing this game worl@@ ds .
2201 T= later that day , i was driving around this property with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
2201 H= i later , later on this site with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems such as natural seems to be , &quot; otherwise as any farm i ever had been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
2201 G= later on the day , i went on this bas@@ ket with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; , unlike any farm , on the i ever been , &quot; how meas@@ st du you succe@@ ed ? &quot;

6148 H= the older black man stood up . he watched the hu@@ pu@@ ty , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i am come , to say , &quot; i am come around to say this young man , they don &apos;t lose the goal . give it not on the eyes . give it not on the eyes .

6096 T= and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dra@@ matic and so beautiful and so in@@ spir@@ ing and so stimul@@ ating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intelle@@ ct and reason .
6096 H= and finally i believe is that , although it is so dra@@ matically and in@@ spir@@ ing , and so stimul@@ ating , not at the end of our technology , not things that we develop , not on our intelle@@ ct , not on our intelle@@ ct and sense .
6096 G= and finally , i think that although it &apos;s so dra@@ matic , so beautiful and in@@ spir@@ ing , and so an@@ xi@@ ous , we &apos;re not in our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our intelle@@ ct and mind .

3672 T= i became en@@ am@@ or@@ ed of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed organisms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is car@@ ried on in both daughter cells .
3672 H= and i fell in love with the strength of evolution , and i realized something very basic reali@@ zation : most of the existence existence organisms organisms in soli@@ c@@ lon@@ ing organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information the cell becomes moves further into both dead cells in both dead cells in both dead cells in both dead cells .
3672 G= i loved myself in the power of evolution , and i put something very fundamental : in the most the existence of life in soli@@ d organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information of cell is continu@@ ed in both cell cells .
3582 T= and , because i was born without the fi@@ bu@@ la b@@ ones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this stran@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .

3498 T= but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
3498 H= but in fact , it was an input on the early 8@@ 0s , as i just began with the primary school and began starting to build my self-@@ view outside my famili@@ ar@@ s-@@ mou@@ ths of my family stock world and forms around me around me around me and the rest world around me around me .

3492 T= i always keep my thes@@ au@@ rus handy whenever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished edi@@ ting the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
3492 H= i kept writing my syn@@ ony@@ mous liter@@ ary liter@@ ary attack , but i &apos;ve been ready to work with the work of writing , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never hit my life in my life , which the word &quot; ab@@ led &quot; really means &quot; ab@@ led &quot; really means .

3320 T= and when we &apos;re in game worl@@ ds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
3320 H= when we are in a gam@@ ble world , i believe that a lot of us turn into our best version of us , any@@ time and inst@@ antly aid ready to solve hard times as long as necessary , try to try to solve as long as necessary , try to try it after the failure again .
3320 G= if we are in a game world , i think , is that many of us turn into our best version , every moment and immediately aid are willing to resol@@ ve har@@ t@@ n@@ ig solving the problem , so long as necessary , try to re@@ move it to the missing rene@@ p again .
563 T= but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teenager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of fe@@ ar-@@ based reaction .
563 H= however , it would be worse though , when i was not remin@@ ded that i years before about 20 years ago , when i first told me that i wanted to be professional auth@@ ority , with the same kind of fear occu@@ pan@@ ed response .

1306 T= imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &apos;d like to close on that sentence a and again give the ad@@ vice that designers must also think differently to arri@@ ve at new solutions , and so i thank you war@@ m@@ ly for your attention and please .
1306 H= imagination is tumor@@ s than being alone , and with that phr@@ ase i would like to finish , a a and another identifi@@ cation , designers need to start differently , designers need to start differently differently to come differently , and in that sense , thank you very heart for attention and please .
1306 G= imagination is more more than one , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to conclu@@ de , a and again the hin@@ t , even designers must be different , to come to new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
1202 T= and if i then place a half o@@ val next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
1202 H= and then , when i then stop a se@@ bo cast , then we watch no longer just see one unit , nam@@ ely , because circle , circle , circle , circle , and , yet we see one unity , we can see a unity , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , another one another one another .
1202 G= and if i hold you one hal@@ bo@@ val se@@ ats , then let &apos;s look at one another unit , which circle , circle , circle , circle , circle , and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a different circle .
1139 T= and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intui@@ tive , increasingly natural , more user friend@@ ly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
1139 H= and there i just stop one of these little devices are high up , because things should increasingly become more intui@@ tively more increasingly more intui@@ tive , more natural user , us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly user , us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively or intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively .
1139 G= and because it &apos;s just holding one of these little devices , because the things are increasingly intui@@ tive , more natural , used more natural , used to use , which is actually for the people of course , which is actually good for people of course , which is user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively .
1014 T= and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transpor@@ ts you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .
1014 H= it &apos;s very amazing because you really believe that this technology you see is that this we@@ ak technology that you see there is actually that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is just us , because you really believe that this technology you see is that this technology you see is that this technology you see there is that this technology you see there is actually that this technology you see there is that this technology you see there is actually that this technology you see that this technology you see is that the future is just in the future , but indeed , the future is that the future is that the future is that the future is just in the future , but indeed ,
1014 G= and that &apos;s very surpris@@ ingly , because you really believe that this we@@ technology technology that you face there , which is actually a future in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s so that the future is right in the future , but in fact , the future is just in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .
864 T= so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequen@@ cing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which si@@ ft@@ ables act as sounds like lead , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms .

724 T= last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demon@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by 40 percent .
724 H= i last year i showed these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s that nearly three million years had had the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , 40 percent of 40 percent reti@@ red 40 percent reti@@ re@@ tt .
724 G= last year , i showed this two of these two fo@@ li@@ es to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ei@@ sk@@ app@@ e , which is approach@@ ing three million years of the size of the bottom 4@@ 8 states .
592 T= and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path of assu@@ mption , particularly given the circum@@ stance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
592 H= i definitely know , i definitely know that it was for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to catch that dark path of assu@@ mption , sort of vulnerable , sort of , particularly surro@@ unded in my career in my career in my career in my career .
592 G= and i definitely definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start to pull down this dark p@@ fa@@ d of the sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ on , especially in my career .
566 T= aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p hea@@ p of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter ash of failure ? &quot;
566 H= did you feel no fear you die this craft work long after life and never occur@@ s something and it never occur@@ s something and that you will die on a cock@@ ro@@ tt@@ ed dreams -- your mouth filled with the less@@ er a@@ version of failure ?
566 G= don &apos;t worry that you &apos;re going to do this hand@@ piece of your life , and then never emer@@ ged something and that you &apos;re going to go to a s@@ ro@@ t@@ th@@ ling dreams are going to die with the bit@@ ter a@@ man of the ver@@ sa@@ gene ?
6157 T= if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a refer@@ end@@ um coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
6157 H= when you live in the california , it &apos;s there in this spring , the decision decisi@@ on-@@ decision decision that it is about companies doing a effort to drive something from power electricity , which otherwise flo@@ ws in the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
6157 G= if you live in california , there is in this spring , there &apos;s a vol@@ k@@ s@@ deci@@ d , where it &apos;s about , in fact , an in@@ genu@@ ance , something of the money of the money of the money .
3583 T= he said to me , &quot; i had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of indepen@@ dence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
3583 H= he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents said that you never walk , and never be so moving your wor@@ ship like others or that you never lead life live a lifetime of life , and then she just pun@@ ched me just lying . &quot;
3583 G= he said to myself , &quot; i had your parents say that you would never walk , and never as moving as other children or that you could never have a independent life , and since then they never have a independent life , and since they were just lying lying . &quot;
3522 T= and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl sha@@ ped my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently strong , powerful and ath@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
3522 H= and i wonder , i wonder what my vision of me as powerful and powerful girl my home@@ made girl sha@@ ped my self sha@@ ped my self sha@@ ped my confidence , and i could imagine as a nature of nature , powerful and venti@@ li@@ th@@ an man .
3522 G= and i ask myself , how much its vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl sha@@ ped my self-@@ image , and i could imagine that , as a result of nature , powerful and at@@ le@@ th@@ ic human .
5460 T= and it &apos;s colle@@ cted by my general prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need car@@ di@@ ologi@@ c support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
5460 H= and it &apos;s also going to call them from my general commun@@ ist , that he can see where my stress problems lies , and it isn &apos;t just at the moment that i car@@ di@@ ological support or that , but also with a view of sight or as , but also with a view in the past .
5460 G= and there you may be ab@@ smell of my single doctor , so he can see where my weight problem is , and it &apos;s not only in the moment , in the moment , in the moment , in the moment , in the way , in the past .
4956 T= it was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ un@@ k of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ un@@ k of metal and you .
4956 H= this was the value for all of these year in the clean space for all of these year in the clean room of space , because , check this , the ma@@ s@@ rob@@ s@@ sp@@ a differ@@ enti@@ al between one single at@@ om and that piece of metal is roughly the range between met@@ all and you .
4956 G= and that was value for all these year in the clean room , because , you see , they te@@ ar it the , the mas@@ s@@ stable difference between one individual at@@ om and that piece of metal is about just as much as the difference between metal metal and them .
4595 T= so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is br@@ and@@ ed from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve-@@ the-@@ ti@@ tle spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x@@ .

4514 T= i started to research scientific liter@@ ature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in nat@@ anz and found they are struc@@ tured in what is called a cas@@ ca@@ de , and each cas@@ ca@@ de holds 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
4514 H= and i began working through studying scientific liter@@ ature over@@ work about how these cent@@ cen@@ fu@@ s in na@@ vel@@ and and figured out that they are struc@@ tured in so-@@ called cas@@ ca@@ ca@@ ds , and every cas@@ ka@@ ge con@@ tains 16@@ 4 cent@@ cent@@ cent@@ 4 cent@@ cent@@ cent cent@@ 4 cent@@ cent@@ cent cent@@ 4 cent@@ cent@@ cent cent@@ 4 cent@@ cent@@ cent cent@@ u@@ ries .

4008 T= and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at an@@ atom@@ y , that we reach the point where we have to ad@@ mit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on an@@ atom@@ y might start fall@@ ing apart ?
4008 H= and for me , is , what are we going to do is , what are we going to do is making a point where we need to ad@@ mit that a democracy focused on atoms towards atoms that occu@@ r on atoms , could fall apart from atoms fall@@ ing towards atoms , could fall apart apart from atoms fall@@ ing apart ?
4008 G= and for myself , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science are doing this progress in the corner of the an@@ atom@@ y , that there is a democracy that would occu@@ r on an@@ atom@@ y ?
3605 T= well , they took , over a three-@@ month period , d-@@ level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-@@ month period , they were per@@ forming at a-@@ level .
3605 H= they said , you have a 3@@ mon@@ th-@@ long period of student students with a &quot; suff@@ i@@ cient &quot; given &quot; the grade &quot; very good . &quot; it was told you they were very smart , and after those three months they have really at@@ tribu@@ ted you . and after those three months , they have really at@@ tribu@@ tes them .
3605 G= they &apos;ve been sho@@ cked over a three-@@ month line period with a &quot; exc@@ use &quot; given a &quot; exc@@ use &quot; the note &quot; very good , &quot; they were told that they were very smart . and after that three months , they really wrote .

2338 T= what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
2338 H= what if we could turn those situation , and putting the internet on your head , so instead of going to go instead of walking from one to another , start to go from many things too many things , and seeing patterns that otherwise vulnerable hidden bor@@ bor@@ hidden rema@@ ins ?
2338 G= what if we rever@@ se circu@@ it these situation and put the internet on the head , so instead of a to others , are starting to go from one to others , start with many things , and you see patterns that would love an@@ son@@ ist ?
2024 T= and so the message is this , we have to make do without these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we actually want to reach our goal of tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y percent , tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , thir@@ ty percent etc .
2024 H= now , the message message is now , we need to ci@@ te on those ro@@ tt@@ ed mas@@ ses , when we sort of sex our goals forced to sex , tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , 40 thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty percent and so forth when we want to achieve at those ro@@ tt@@ ed mas@@ ses , when we sort of have to er@@ ase on these ro@@ tt@@ ing-@@ end mas@@ ses , when we sort of ab@@ led our goals somehow inevi@@ t@@ ably , tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty percent , 40 thir@@ ty percent , thir@@ ty , 20 thir@@ ty percent , inevi@@ t@@ ably , thir@@ ty percent , 40 thir@@ ty percent , inevi@@ t@@ ably , thir@@ ty percent , 20 thir@@ ty percent thir@@ ty percent ,
2024 G= and the message is well , we have quot@@ ed to these ro@@ tat@@ ing ma@@ vers , if we tw@@ ent@@ y of our goals , 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , thir@@ ty , 30 percent and so on , if we reach at all .
1926 T= and then i stuck to it until n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y six and then i became the co-@@ fo@@ under of the company sol@@ on together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world together with the sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ -@@ cells .

1390 T= that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no natu@@ re-@@ et@@ -@@ pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s or whatever they &apos;re all called , that per@@ mit@@ s our own ex@@ cre@@ ment to be put back into the cycle .
1390 H= that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty to the earth that we say , there isn &apos;t bio@@ -@@ far@@ construction construction , no tu@@ ol@@ and no bi@@ ol@@ and no sy@@ ll@@ o pro@@ gr@@ ession and as you all call , which allow us to go back all the means that our own ex@@ credit cancer .
1390 G= that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on the earth that we say . there &apos;s no bio@@ -@@ far@@ ming , not a bi@@ ol@@ and , no fin@@ ite pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s and how they all are , which allow you to all the means that our own ex@@ cre@@ ments .
1157 T= that was also an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t at the time , where the gent@@ ry , c@@ ler@@ gy@@ men and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally f@@ at@@ al of course .
1157 H= and then it was just as a ap@@ r@@ on , where a@@ sk@@ ul@@ us and others said : so@@ ap your actually thri@@ g@@ ingly fren@@ g@@ gling , when reading people start read , then the after@@ wards , and of course , the after@@ wards , and that &apos;s obviously totally tra@@ p .
1157 G= in the time , it &apos;s just a mon@@ r@@ on@@ t , where a@@ del , cla@@ er@@ us and others said , you &apos;re actually in@@ san@@ g , if the people starts , you want to take the after@@ wards , and that &apos;s obviously totally f@@ at@@ al .
6285 T= better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , h@@ d video and still images , libr@@ aries of books and music , medical diagno@@ stic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ ali@@ zing and demon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing into your cell@@ phone .
6285 H= and it &apos;s still better , the things you spent and i spent multiple dollars -- gps video video video and photos , library video and photos , library han@@ gs filled with books and music to medical diagno@@ stics -- become physi@@ cally materi@@ alized and che@@ aper in your mobile phones .
6285 G= and it comes better , the things that you and i spend multiple thousand dollars -- gps , h@@ d video and photo , libr@@ aries and photo , libr@@ aries full of books and music , technology is literally dis@@ materi@@ alized and che@@ aper in your cell .
3527 T= so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt is our greatest as@@ set .
3527 H= so maybe , perhaps light light visible light because ever that there was ever there ever gave one other truth , nam@@ ely anyone man who can give a very special process and very powerful it can and human ability to ada@@ pt , custom@@ ize our size of our size , our size plus is .
3527 G= and perhaps illu@@ str@@ ating that technological transformation , because the one that there was always a other truth , which is that every human of society is something quite special and very powerful and very powerful and powerful , and that the human ability , to suit , ada@@ pt our biggest plus .
2584 T= so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
2584 H= so there &apos;s a great prize of pri@@ ority : there are challenges at the over@@ mission , and for example , when we say , for example , lies the energy source outside the country is , you need to avoid the resources from wher@@ ever comes from where the energy comes from wher@@ ever comes from where the energy comes from wher@@ ever comes from where it comes differently .
2584 G= so there are great pri@@ ces , and there are challenges in the face . if we say for example , that the energy source outside of the country , you don &apos;t need the technology , you need to deal with the risk that the energy from where different .
6054 T= he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ entation of the spirit , a will@@ ing@@ ness to sometimes be in hop@@ eless places and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
6054 H= &quot; as we strug@@ gl@@ ed in eastern europe against op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted everything we could . but what most of us most needed was hope , a mental re@@ ori@@ ination , sometimes at hop@@ eless places , sometimes to be less hop@@ eless places , and be hop@@ eless and wit@@ ness . &quot;
6054 G= &quot; when we were fighting in o@@ ta@@ pi@@ a , against the under@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most needed , was a mental gui@@ dance , the will@@ ing@@ ness , the will@@ ing@@ ness , sometimes of hop@@ eless places , and wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing places . &quot;
5705 T= but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
5705 H= in it inside -- what i &apos;ve done is , i took taken these code -- the code made made out of normal letters , which we use to symbo@@ li@@ ze -- and i wrote my bro@@ it@@ en@@ it@@ u on a piece of dna and rein@@ forced it 10 ^ 2@@ 22 times en@@ forced 10 ^ 22 times .
5705 G= in it is -- what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code is from normal letters , which we li@@ ze to symbo@@ lic -- and i &apos;ve written my vis@@ it@@ en@@ map on a piece of dna and wrote 10 ^ 22 times .
4937 T= i mean , when i &apos;m in an el@@ ev@@ ator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , frank@@ ly , sc@@ are them .
4937 H= i mean , when i am g alone alone alone , i do all kinds of weird things but then other people go towards other people and i stop making all of those things because i don &apos;t want it with insu@@ lation or , frank@@ ly , they pass track track .
4937 G= i mean , if i stand alone in the el@@ g , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people clim@@ b and i listen to all of these things , because i don &apos;t leave it with it , or frank@@ ly , frank@@ ly , frank@@ ly .
4511 T= what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive ma@@ inten@@ ance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
4511 H= what we also discovered is is that the goal was actually the goal of attack , leaving it slowly and secre@@ tly happen -- obviously trying to allow responsi@@ bilities to allow engineering engineer engineers , so that they won &apos;t be able to come up quickly quickly too .
4511 G= what we &apos;ve found out is that the goal of the attack of attack , it &apos;s slowly and un@@ mar@@ ked -- obviously in the attemp@@ t engineer engineers des@@ per@@ ate , so they &apos;re not able to be able to go into the situation that they would not be able to go out there .
4314 T= i met these guys called gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a las@@ er poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space .
4314 H= and i gather@@ ed these people of gra@@ il , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab and you have a technology allo@@ wing you to proje@@ ct light light on any surface surface on any surface surface and then record with a las@@ er pun@@ ch@@ line that contro@@ ls only the negative area is regi@@ ster@@ ed the negative area only regi@@ stration the negative area that contro@@ ls only the negative area of space .
4314 G= i met these people of gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows you to try to proje@@ ct a light on every arb@@ age surface , and then regi@@ ster@@ ed with a las@@ er@@ pun@@ ter on it , which is regi@@ ster@@ ed the negative surface .
4004 T= henry , by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the x@@ y one -- by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male is now li@@ able to be dra@@ f@@ ted , which mary does not need to worry about .
4004 H= h@@ im@@ up , because you assu@@ me that it &apos;s male -- although not told you that it is at x@@ y is -- because you assu@@ me that he is man@@ ually , it can be raised now , it can now be brought in , which mar@@ ia must not have to worry about .
4004 G= h@@ ein@@ rich , because you assu@@ me that he &apos;s male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the x@@ y -- because you assu@@ me that he is male , he can actually put it in , which mar@@ ia has no worry about .
3698 T= so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
3698 H= so what that means is , when we look back on what happens in evolution , and as we think about humans in evolution , and as we think about humans in evolution , and particularly as we look forward in the next stage , and i would say there is a series of opportunity .
3698 G= so , what that means is , if we look at this , which is happening in evolution , and how we &apos;re thinking about the place of the people in the evolution , and especially as we predi@@ ct in the next phase , i would say that there is a series of possibilities .
90 T= now , the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ cise sort necessary to poten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question .
90 H= now the fascinating thing is that the vas@@ cular in@@ cin@@ in@@ ine , which inclu@@ de in the li@@ an@@ e , ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of exactly the species that is necessary to poten@@ tially be poten@@ tially to poten@@ tially poten@@ ze the yp@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins too . ask yourself yourself .
90 G= well , the intri@@ gu@@ ing is that the be@@ k@@ k@@ arb@@ ol@@ ine that con@@ tain in the li@@ an@@ e , ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the same way , which is necessary to poten@@ tially poten@@ tially the tra@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
3196 T= and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ g@@ ging the experi@@ en@@ cing self through experiences that the experi@@ en@@ cing self doesn &apos;t need .
3196 H= and basically , you can see that , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of memory self , and you can remember self remin@@ der self than one that sort of experience living through experiences that won &apos;t need living through experiences that won &apos;t need living itself through experiences that won &apos;t need living itself through experiences that didn &apos;t need living itself .
3196 G= and basically , you can look at that , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ne@@ i of the reme@@ dy themselves , and you can think of themselves as one , which is a sort of kind of re@@ vi@@ ving even worse through experiences that the er@@ alive itself doesn &apos;t need .
361 T= finally , one consequ@@ ence of buying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
361 H= ultimately , a series of pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing any kind of buying any kind of buy is that if you &apos;re peace is that if you are peace peace , and you wonder why who &apos;s responsible , which is obvious , which is responsible : what would you possibly do ?
361 G= finally , a follow of the buy a bad seat je@@ ans if there &apos;s only one way to buy , that if they are un@@ happy , and ask questions why , who accoun@@ ts , the answer is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . what would you do ?
2529 T= in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person .

3169 T= and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ en@@ cing self of patient a worse off , and you have the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
3169 H= for a few minutes , and for a few minutes , you make causes that life is the living self from a a worse light is , and you causes causes that the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self from a patient is much better off because you have given a better story about his experience .
3169 G= and if you do that for a few minutes , man has been doing a better story about his experience .
3167 T= now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ gling it too much .
3167 H= now , what you could do with a patient with a patient , and we actually have clinical experiments done , and it works , and it works , it &apos;s actually poten@@ tially shif@@ ting the repres@@ entation of patient by just le@@ tting it too g without too much to him too .
3167 G= well , what you could do with patient a , and we &apos;ve condu@@ cted clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually trans@@ late the dar@@ k@@ refle@@ ction of patient a compar@@ ison by the patient a very clo@@ sely with him too much .
65 T= and for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that main@@ tain the pro@@ position that their pra@@ yers and their pra@@ yers alone main@@ tain the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we might say the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- balance .

2447 T= and taking them down so that they had access -- astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and le@@ tting them see , and take sam@@ ples and test instru@@ ments , and so on .
2447 H= i accep@@ ted them with them and turn them access to the world around the world : astro@@ biolog@@ ologists , planet@@ scientist scientists who interested interested themselves for such extre@@ mes situations , people interested interested in those institutions , and i embra@@ ce them to the sources , take track and tools and tools able tools and tools and tools and tools and tools and tools and tools and tools .
2447 G= i took them with them with and she@@ t you have access to the world since the bottom : astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ en@@ scientists , people interested in these extreme situations , so i took them to the sources with it , sam@@ ple , sam@@ ple and instru@@ ments and so on .
108 T= you know , geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of a people is univer@@ s@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univer@@ s@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , cele@@ br@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
108 H= you know , you know that the physical extin@@ ction of humans becomes twice my jud@@ gment generally , but the eth@@ no@@ cide eth@@ no@@ cian , the destruction of human humans , is not only becoming jud@@ ged , but generally my and lar@@ ge-@@ scale as part of an develop@@ mental strategy as part of an develop@@ mental strategy .
108 G= you know , the geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of people will be cele@@ br@@ ated general , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ d , the destruction of the lifest@@ yle of the lives of people , it &apos;s not just not con@@ vi@@ cted , not only not con@@ vi@@ cted , not only not con@@ vi@@ cted , rather than part of a developing strategy .
2248 T= so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that meas@@ ures its success by the health of its predat@@ ors , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fication plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
2248 H= so , no one farm not just not just a farm whose animals not feed , not just a farm meas@@ uring her success at the health of her predat@@ ors , it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water@@ shop , and isn &apos;t just for those fish but for you and me .
2248 G= not only one farm that fe@@ es their animals not fe@@ eding , not only one farm which mis@@ sts their predat@@ ors , but a farm that is literally a water facili@@ ty plant , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water facili@@ ty plant , and not just for those fish , but also for you and myself .
1805 T= in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness .
1805 H= so here you have this sor scen@@ ario between the im@@ conscious and conscious awareness immediately , without doing anything against anything you can do without doing something against , and things that you know is that it looks a lot better for you and others can sound much better for you and others sound and sound others .
1805 G= so here you have this cen@@ su@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious , who immediately jum@@ ps , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know is that they look quite different , so that they can make much better for them and others .
1565 T= everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a transl@@ ator can &apos;t just simply ren@@ der a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation can occu@@ r .
1565 H= that as trans@@ lation doesn &apos;t just have word word word word word trans@@ mit words trans@@ mit into another language , but also understanding the deep@@ est sense of words and what nap@@ us@@ ory cur@@ tain needs , anyone who has contribu@@ ted to a sense of trans@@ lation , anyone who has contribu@@ ted with foreign languages .
1565 G= that man is not just transl@@ ated word for word the text is trans@@ mit@@ ted in a different language , but even the deep meaning of the words and wor@@ thy optimis@@ m , so there &apos;s a sense of good trans@@ lation , everybody knows that it has to do with stran@@ gest languages .
302 T= understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .
302 H= you understand that this is not just means that this means food food feed food when they go into the distance , because they have no money back to the back , because they have no money back to the back , means that decisions affect large investment comm@@ and@@ ments custom@@ er their emplo@@ yers .
302 G= you understand that that doesn &apos;t mean , that people have food food food , if you go in the ru@@ he@@ stood , because they don &apos;t enough money to return , it does mean that they have great invest@@ ments bo@@ ats of their labor .
6605 T= for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that some present , as cap@@ tain so-@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ tili@@ zed by fis@@ her@@ y scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
6605 H= so , for instance , it &apos;s that the report of a cap@@ tain such such as obser@@ ving large fishing advan@@ tages , which obser@@ ved large fishing reser@@ ves , cannot be used , or from fishing scientists usually cannot be valu@@ ed , because usually it isn &apos;t scienti@@ fically scienti@@ fically .
6605 G= so , for example , the an@@ ec@@ the@@ te that the repor@@ ts of a chap@@ ter so@@ und@@ as , who watched in this neighborhood , not used to be used , not used , or fishing scientists don &apos;t normally be adverti@@ sed , because it &apos;s not &quot; scienti@@ fically . &quot;
1068 T= and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m de@@ pic@@ ted the ge@@ ology and to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region and that of course also made it possible to de@@ frag@@ ment these songs and re@@ ar@@ range them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point .
1068 H= and of course these sounds and of that rhyth@@ m that repres@@ ented the psychology repres@@ ented a region , and obviously en@@ ab@@ led the death of death , naturally en@@ ables those songs de@@ frag@@ ment and put together on the left , after right and also able to move back on the right , and also able to move back to the ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ on place .
1068 G= and these sound and these rhyth@@ m has repres@@ ented the ge@@ ology , the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region , and that has naturally en@@ able that you could de@@ frag@@ mented the songs of these songs , and in the right , on the right , on the right , on the right and even back to the ex@@ gan@@ g@@ a .
3732 T= what if you could change the sper@@ m and the o@@ va , or change the new@@ ly ferti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g , and give your off@@ spring a better chance at a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- elimin@@ ate the diabetes , elimin@@ ate the he@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a , reduce the risk of cancer ?
3732 H= what about if you could change sper@@ mi@@ cs and ir@@ cells or cells or poten@@ tially ferti@@ li@@ zed painting to change your kids a better chance for saving life to live live live life -- elimin@@ ation diabetes , elimin@@ ating cancer of cancer , elimin@@ ating cancer from cancer ?
3732 G= what would be if you could change the sper@@ m and ir@@ on or the fresh eg@@ g , could make a better opportunity for a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- obs@@ essi@@ onal life , obs@@ essi@@ ve the risk of cro@@ m@@ op@@ hil@@ y , the risk of cancer ?
5606 T= now how many times have we ele@@ cted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader ele@@ cted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to refle@@ ct our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
5606 H= how often do we ele@@ ct a political ele@@ ction -- and sometimes we consum@@ ed a crowd of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we live ourselves back and we expect that the government , our values refle@@ cts our values and ful@@ fil@@ ls our needs , our values res@@ ur@@ ge our needs , and then hasn &apos;t changed much changed ?

5687 T= and i think that there &apos;s theor@@ ies that are beginning to understand about how it started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemicals in them .
5687 H= i also believe there is theor@@ ies starting understanding how everything with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ fied story about which is that at this period of little oil pe@@ tr@@ esses around which various types of reci@@ pes for chemicals that share various types of reci@@ pes for chemicals used chemicals .
5687 G= i also believe there is some theor@@ ies that started to understand how everything has started with r@@ na , but i &apos;ll tell you a simpli@@ stic story about which is that , at that time , little oil sp@@ ill around , which reve@@ als different kinds of re@@ cep@@ ts for chemicals .
3139 T= and then there is a reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that kee@@ ps sc@@ ore , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot;
3139 H= and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and that memory self is that that recei@@ ve itself is that , the coun@@ ty and your record of life susta@@ in life , and it &apos;s the person who asks the doctor asking asking asking the question : &quot; how did you percei@@ ve yourself in last year ? &quot;
3139 G= and then there &apos;s a memor@@ ial of itself , and that reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed yourself , and the story of our lives , and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s that the doctor talks about , &quot; how did you feel felt in the last time ? &quot;
3105 T= people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
3105 H= and the people in the back or seeing the that later eventually see video video , say , &quot; now , this is pretty impres@@ sive full of , but if it were really , if it was really , dig@@ nity here , it is a hole there and where it really was , if it really would be , it would be flo@@ ated . &quot;
3105 G= the people back , or the , you see , at some point , you &apos;ll say , &quot; well , yes , that looks quite clo@@ sely , but if it &apos;s real , it would be a hole and there , here &apos;s a hole and there , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it would really be real if it would be really real , it would flo@@ at . &quot;
5469 T= and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , dou@@ bled demand and things like that .
5469 H= at that point the view is coming in the game , and you can not only take control control of control on your own ship , but can also help us address healthcare with healthcare that fall front us us , and the free explosion of public health club , dou@@ bled demand , dou@@ bled demand , and so on .
5469 G= in this point , patients in the game , and you can &apos;t only take the control of their own ship , but you can help health care of health care , but may be helping care of the challenges that are wrong , and the free explosion of the health care , double demand , and so on .
5118 T= now in the financial sav@@ ings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice off@@ er@@ ings has actually been something that david la@@ ib@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
5118 H= now in the world of saving , i believe one of the best examples recently who have recently come to market recently , how best you say the best choice opportunities , was something where david tru@@ ib@@ son has led very stron@@ g@@ ly mit , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s going to be off@@ ered at harvard .
5118 G= well in the world of the sav@@ ings , i think of one of the best examples that are recently taken on the market , about how man is man@@ ual man@@ ual , was something that has a great deal with the david la@@ ib@@ son &apos;s very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s off@@ ered at harvard .
5001 T= so the ted@@ talk la@@ id out in very simple terms , a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited land , a char@@ ter that speci@@ fi@@ es the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in , to go live under those rules or not .
5001 H= so the ted@@ talk , which led in very simple form of speech , that a far@@ der city is a place where the first ab@@ and@@ oned the law that defin@@ es laws the laws which deter@@ mine the laws that deter@@ mine the ability to decide either living under those rules or not either under those rules or not .
5001 G= so ted@@ talk , in a very simple form , that a char@@ ter city is a place where ini@@ tially un@@ lived country , a fo@@ unding country , a fo@@ unding country that determin@@ es the laws of choice , either under this rules , either under this rules or not .
4583 T= so what you were getting was this : your name here pres@@ ents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depen@@ ding on the content , could ultimately b@@ low up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
4583 H= so what you saw was this : her name here pres@@ ents : my ted@@ talk , which you have no idea what being subject becomes , and ever after content end to the e@@ e@@ u@@ down to fly the e@@ ars , especially when i walk your company for their participa@@ tion sho@@ wer in your participa@@ tion sho@@ wer .
4583 G= so what i thought was , her name here : her name here : my ted@@ talk , who you have no idea , which is the top@@ ic , and the one of them depen@@ ding on the e@@ ye@@ flies , especially , if i lay out their company for their participa@@ tion .
4532 T= now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the input values from sensor@@ s -- so for example , from pressure sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tion sensor@@ s -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ mate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fa@@ ke input data .
4532 H= now , what this thing is is that it begins the remarkable values from sensor@@ s -- so for example of print sensor@@ s , so for example of print sensor@@ s and bra@@ bra@@ tion sensor@@ s -- and giving legi@@ ti@@ ms available during attack , walking through the attack , with wrong data , walking through wrong data , walking through wrong data , walking through wrong data , running wrong .
4532 G= well , what works that this thing works is that it starts with sensor@@ s values -- so , for example , prin@@ sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tional sensor@@ s , vi@@ bra@@ tional sensor@@ s -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ ms code , with fol@@ ding data , running with fal@@ se data .
43 T= we tra@@ ced gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight generations , and we found two in@@ stances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
43 H= we followed eight generations followed eight generations and we found two cases of one natural death dea@@ ths and as we intervie@@ wed people with prin@@ ting people wonder@@ ing people wonder@@ ing people that one of the people become age as age , that he died died of his age and we killed him still with the spe@@ ar .
43 G= we followed the gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations , and two cases of a natural death , and two cases of a natural death and when we asked the people to print something about it , that one of the people turned old , and we killed him with the spe@@ ars .
91 T= how , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cular plants , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally un@@ related plants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
91 H= how can those people can come from an 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ str@@ ating plants find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologist plants find finding those two mor@@ ph@@ ologist plants that find , when in those fashion , create kind of organic chemical version , such that the entire total of its parts ?
91 G= how can these people are combin@@ ed from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 ways of ad@@ string plants find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally not related plants , combin@@ ing a way of bio@@ chemical version , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts ?
3048 T= and we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fing@@ ers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
3048 H= and now you could talk about this is why this is an as@@ sur@@ ation , why you can not percei@@ ve that here below only three fing@@ ers here : because the minds and the kind of how it app@@ lies information , one , two , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , it &apos;s just why you see information , because the minds understood and the kind of thing process@@ ing is why you &apos;re not percei@@ ved , one , two , three , three , three , three , three , three , one , two , three , three , three , three , three , three , three
3048 G= and now , you could talk about why this is a de@@ ception is why you &apos;re not percei@@ ving , that here &apos;s only three fing@@ ers , because the mind and the way it works information , it doesn &apos;t matter , one , two , three , but it sees it as a group .
2637 T= if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a v@@ acc@@ ine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
2637 H= one wish for the next 50 years , i could sele@@ ct a wish for the next 50 years , i could sele@@ ct president presi@@ dents , and i love this desire choo@@ sing , which is , se@@ bi@@ zed energy epi@@ cycle , that wish i am .
2637 G= if you just just one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , i could choose a v@@ acc@@ ine , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and that love , or i could choose this wish , the is hal@@ bi@@ zed energy agen@@ cy , that desire .
2062 T= but as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these schizophren@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des , the worst of which can mani@@ fest themselves as and then disappe@@ aring for days , wander@@ ing the streets of sk@@ id row , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed upon him .
2062 H= and as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to those schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases -- those are sometimes so bad , and wa@@ sting it disappe@@ ars , and van@@ bor@@ ed disappe@@ aring , walking around the streets of sk@@ id around the street and tor@@ ter@@ source his own intellectual spirit .
2062 G= as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases . these are sometimes so bad , and it disappe@@ ars so bad , and it disappe@@ ars , in the streets of sc@@ id row around the streets of sc@@ id row around that hor@@ ror and ex@@ posed the tor@@ qu@@ als of his own mind .
406 T= when we look at its me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a living cell .
406 H= now , when we watch this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ sche map that is very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward , relative to our . trust me , this is sim@@ le , but if we can all look at those genes that we can see one after another , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would be very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell .
406 G= but if we look at this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ man map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust them , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes are looking at one to the other one is very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell .
334 T= and there was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ vor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra@@ p , and they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if you wor@@ e them long enough and wash@@ ed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
334 H= and there was a period where there was just any kind of history , and you bl@@ ast them , mis@@ sed you , mis@@ sed you mis@@ sed , they were incredibly un@@ com@@ sequ@@ el and long enough long enough , they started feeling &quot; ok &quot; too .
334 G= and there was a time in which there were always any kind of a way , and they bought it , and they f@@ f@@ ed bad , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable and often enough enough , you have enough un@@ comp@@ elling , and if they had long enough , they started &quot; ok . &quot;
6418 T= about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs brought her back to the emergen@@ cy department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in sever@@ e sho@@ ck .
6418 H= about an hour after coming home she went home after home having ended down@@ sta@@ irs , collap@@ sed her home and 9 / 11 called 9@@ 11 at 9 / 11 , and the res@@ cu@@ res@@ saving assi@@ stance with a blood print of 50 , that is an en@@ danger@@ ed la@@ cket state , which is a dangerous la@@ cket state .
6418 G= about one hour after that she arrived at home , after i took it home , after i sent it home , it collap@@ sed and called the family called 9@@ 11 . the res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion assi@@ stant house with a blood pressure of 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous sho@@ ck state .
126 T= and it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ dens find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
126 H= and we become opportunity to be re@@ disco@@ vering the possibility of what we are : people conscious awareness awareness aware of the importance of awareness awareness aware that all humans and gar@@ dens to be able to wit@@ ness , and there &apos;s great moments of optimis@@ m . and there &apos;s great moments moments of optimis@@ m .
126 G= and in this song , we &apos;re going to re@@ discover the possibility that we are : people with fol@@ lem , who consci@@ ously aware of the importance of importance , that all people and g@@ arb@@ age is a room of ge@@ ar . and there &apos;s great moments of the organis@@ m .
1100 T= there are technical concep@@ ts such as <<unk>> aug@@ mented reality <<unk>> .
1100 H= so , when you look at google glas@@ ses for example , then then is such a notion that allows us to re@@ com@@ bine the virtual world combin@@ ed us with the physical world with the physical world with the virtual world as something ordinary , naturally , becomes re@@ com@@ men@@ ded .
1100 G= so if you look at google glass glas@@ ses , then it &apos;s such a concept that makes the virtual world with the real world with real world with real world , which is to embra@@ ce our mon@@ in@@ ity to virtual architecture , which is virtual as something normal , natural , natural .
2563 T= those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .
2563 H= now those may contribu@@ te an yo@@ yo@@ asked mission , and as you better than i expected , this is great , but my core stat@@ ement here is is that at all of those those those five five jobs , and we can &apos;t give up of them because they give us sh@@ ets , because all have significant problems have known known problems .
2563 G= so , maybe you have a moder@@ ate contribu@@ tion , and if you do better than i expect , this would be great , but my nuclear ex@@ ecu@@ tion here is that we have to work on all j@@ ens , and we can &apos;t get out of them , because they &apos;re un@@ prote@@ cted , because all of the problems have significant problems .
2566 T= now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tri@@ cky , and agre@@ eing on where these co2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long-term issue .

2438 T= and it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures that i can imagine , as a science fi@@ ction fan .

2502 T= if you sum up the co2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect effects , in that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these ra@@ pid changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
2502 H= it combin@@ ed co2 that leading rise to ther@@ ther@@ increasing increase , which lead rise to ther@@ ther@@ increasing increase , has followed some consequences consequences -- effects effects on weather , and perhaps worse , the indi@@ rec@@ tly consequ@@ ence that the eco@@ systems can not ada@@ pt and fall up all systems together and fall up all systems together and collapse all systems together systems .

3296 T= so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intui@@ tive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , o@@ bes@@ ity , i believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
3296 H= this seems to first come g@@ g@@ g , so i repe@@ at it to make it happen : when problems of hunger hunger , poverty , global conflict , global conflict , global conflict , global conflict , global conflict , global conflict global conflict for at least 21 billion hours per week for the end of the next decade or playing the end of the next decade .
3296 G= and it seems to be something ab@@ we@@ gi@@ g , so again , let &apos;s do it , so if we ask problems like hunger , poverty , global confli@@ cts and o@@ bes@@ ity and o@@ bes@@ ity , i think , we &apos;re trying to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .

5112 T= but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous red@@ und@@ ant op@@ tions , well there &apos;s an increase in sal@@ es , there &apos;s a lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs , there is an impro@@ vement of the choo@@ sing experience .

1974 T= and we simul@@ ated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conven@@ tional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fif@@ ty cents per k@@ w@@ h after tw@@ ent@@ y years , you &apos;d arri@@ ve at about fort@@ y-@@ four cents .

907 T= and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simpli@@ fying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of pos@@ ing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better .
907 H= the problem , this is not just an engineering problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a simple problem , it can just be easy to be an easy problem , thro@@ wing a question , and how can you be able to throw a question , and how can you be able to do that anything or how can you do that better or how can you do that better or how can you make that better or how can you do that better or how can you be able to do that .

52 T= there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assu@@ mption being that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa had no religious belie@@ fs . well , of course , they did and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dist@@ il@@ lation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sla@@ very era .
52 H= one continu@@ ent is increasingly ab@@ led , because the guess was that africa don &apos;t agree in black africa no religious belief in black z@@ africa is no religious belief . obviously it gave you a vo@@ vo@@ o of this very profound religious religious thought during the port@@ onic di@@ ases of sla@@ vi@@ an en@@ sla@@ a of sla@@ vi@@ an era of sla@@ vi@@ an era period .

586 T= but we don &apos;t even blin@@ k when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely intern@@ alized and accep@@ ted colle@@ c@@ tively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ stry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to an@@ gu@@ ish .

620 T= and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures who take dic@@ tation from the di@@ v@@ ine .

3210 T= and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ di@@ cate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer .
3210 H= and if you vote a different vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between your both species of self and minds you need to think about thinking about how you decide that conflict and that is really not obvious , because when you think math in the sense of time you may have an answer . and when you think in memory of memory you might think one another answer .

3645 T= in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center bran@@ ching out in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , every exi@@ sting species at the ti@@ ps of those bran@@ ches has succe@@ e@@ ded in evolutionary terms : it has survi@@ ved ; it has demon@@ strated a fit@@ ness to its environment .
3645 H= and in this image , i &apos;ve held a bush as the center of bran@@ g@@ all direc@@ tions in all direc@@ tions , because when you watch looking looking at the changing tree of life looking at the tops of this dou@@ ght have succe@@ ed success in evolutionary terms : you have survive ; it has his environment fit@@ ness and strength demon@@ strated its surro@@ und@@ ness and strength demon@@ strated .

2433 T= and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ aled it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .

2836 T= we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we bat@@ t@@ led progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
2836 H= we &apos;re on the th@@ res@@ hold too amazing , amazing events on lots of fields , and yet i really really realize that we need hundreds of 300 years coming back to find a period where we have progress progress in which we have progress that we have done progress about these things le@@ f@@ ter over these things have tri@@ st@@ al driven , to more front than right now now .
2836 G= we &apos;re an amazing , amazing events , amazing events in many fields , and yet i really think that we have hundreds , 300 years before the resol@@ ution , to get a time , in which we &apos;re dealing with progress , in which we &apos;re strug@@ gling about these things , in which we &apos;re strug@@ gling about these things of he@@ f@@ ti@@ gers than now .
3517 T= i had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able repe@@ ti@@ tions of exer@@ cis@@ es with these thi@@ ck , el@@ a@@ stic b@@ ands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg mus@@ cles , and i hat@@ ed these b@@ ands more than anything -- i hat@@ ed them , had names for them . i hat@@ ed them .
3517 H= i had to re@@ cover individual prac@@ cies repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly repe@@ ated with these thi@@ cks , el@@ el@@ a@@ stic color@@ ed color -- you know , building my leg muscle muscle , and i hat@@ ed these ben@@ ders more than anything else , i &apos;ve been has@@ sed them . i has@@ sed her . i has@@ sed her . i has@@ sed them .
3517 G= i had always appar@@ ently un@@ finally often repe@@ ated with this thi@@ ck , el@@ ast@@ ish b@@ uns -- in various colors -- which you know , to build my leg muscle . and i hat@@ ed these b@@ fe@@ es of more hat@@ ed than everything else . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them .
5430 T= so by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photogra@@ phic de@@ fe@@ cts like dep@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically .
5430 H= so by watching color , contr@@ ast and hel@@ eness to the shif@@ changes the individual images inte@@ gration photograph@@ ed images , including fish men acts as ro@@ d@@ deep , ab@@ se@@ sat@@ ed colors and break@@ through@@ s , allo@@ wing boundar@@ ies between images and let them look like a single photo appe@@ ars , although an image appe@@ als hundreds of st@@ ages .

6275 T= and the conversation i had with de@@ an kamen this morning , one of the great di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission to do so -- his technology called sl@@ ing@@ shot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dor@@ m room re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .

6485 T= if i were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cra@@ ck a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
6485 H= and when i went to a room filled with various colleagues and requ@@ est your sol@@ require help and tell them what i just talked about , what i just talked about , what i just talked about , would i probably won &apos;t achieve the end of second story , before it would really be un@@ comfortable , anyone would agree a funny one would agree a jo@@ ke , she would change swi@@ t@@ ching and rest the rest .
6485 G= if i live in a room full of with collea@@ gue , and to ask their so@@ sal assi@@ stance and ask them to tell you , what i told you , i would really probably not likely to reach the end of the second story , before it would introduce you to really un@@ pleas@@ ant dig@@ nity , they would make the issue and forget the rest .
427 T= but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
427 H= however , we still wanted us to go far further . we wanted to build a large bacteri@@ ular chromo@@ so@@ m -- more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 accoun@@ tan@@ ic code genetic code -- so we thought we build it in ta@@ pe size of the size of the virus we could vari@@ ate the size of the ta@@ pe could create what those individual components are a living cell .
427 G= but what we were trying to do is we wanted to build a total of bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some . it has more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters gene@@ tics . so we thought we &apos;re building it in k@@ asse@@ ts of the size of the virus that we could vari@@ ate the size of the virus that we &apos;re able to understand what the individual components are a living cell .
1418 T= the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate bi@@ og@@ as , on one he@@ ct@@ are of land with five thousand in@@ habit@@ ants in the fa@@ vel@@ as , a far@@ mer can ear@@ n about one thousand five hundred dollars and main@@ tain the p@@ lot with it , raise chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s and du@@ cks and grow vege@@ tables and farm fish .
1418 H= it &apos;s actually pretty fun doing this is , so agriculture power power , bi@@ og@@ a , be@@ gur@@ a , in a ac@@ r@@ on ar land with five thousand living neighbor@@ ho@@ ods in fa@@ vel@@ as , can build a far@@ mer around one-@@ thousand dollars and waiting waiting and pig@@ s and pig@@ s and pig@@ s and fish and spirit and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish
1418 G= what &apos;s actually beautiful is if you do that , well , agriculture does , bi@@ og@@ as gener@@ ates on a he@@ ct@@ ar country with fif@@ th in fa@@ vel@@ as , there is a far@@ er about one-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -@@ 100 dollars , and the plant so wait , chi@@ ck@@ ers and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and wh@@ ales and vege@@ tables and wh@@ ales and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and wh@@ ales and vege@@ tables .

2701 T= but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;

2701 G= but my dream here is that if you embra@@ ced it economic , and at the same time we elimin@@ ate it , then say the skep@@ tics say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not interested in that it doesn &apos;t em@@ it@@ ted , i almost wish that it &apos;s the val@@ te , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheap than the previous method . &quot;
3191 T= it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies with two different surge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that choo@@ ses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be cho@@ sen .

101 T= well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed for its wars or its technological innova@@ tions , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either ac@@ tively end@@ or@@ sed or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
101 H= now , fact , the fact is , you remember the t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century , in 300 years , won &apos;t remember his wars or technological innovation , it becomes more than an era towards ourselves and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet were either tively accep@@ ted or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted , so that problem is not change .
101 G= so , the fact is that you &apos;re going to be in 300 years , not for his wars or technological innova@@ tions , but rather than an an era , in which we train against , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity in the earth are either active suppor@@ tive of the biological and cultural diversity in either of the earth . so that problem isn &apos;t the shift .

1908 T= i probably bel@@ ong , are those two friend@@ ly girls still here , i probably bel@@ ong to the generation that created this bad e@@ col@@ o@@ gical image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en se@@ vent@@ y nine , i think it &apos;s called k@@ it today .
1908 H= i &apos;m probably heard , the two nice girls still da da , i heard to be born to the generation that orche@@ strated for this bad au@@ low-@@ image image , because i nin@@ un@@ ten@@ si@@ 7@@ 0s already started studying mes@@ indian construction , tech high school , i call engineering high school , tech high school , i believe , i believe , k@@ it@@ te .

2395 T= so , i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with reali@@ stic human emo@@ tive characters gener@@ ated in c@@ g , and the main characters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g .
2395 H= i had written this piece &quot; apo@@ fa@@ ar , &quot; this piece &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , the meas@@ les of visual effects and computer@@ computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated effects in completely new hei@@ ghts , with physical human human , expres@@ sive human , expres@@ sive person@@ ality more expres@@ sive characteri@@ stics , and the major characters should all be g . and the key characters should all be g . and the world should all be g . and the world should be g . and the world should be g .

3129 T= now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a questi@@ on-@@ and-@@ answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound .

4119 T= now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensor@@ s colle@@ cting information from the car , trans@@ mit@@ ting this information into the system , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is colle@@ cted .
4119 H= now today , take you today , if you want a race , you need something like this -- something over@@ wash@@ ing the car in real tv , a few thousand brains who pass information information from the car , giving pass that information on the system , pass pass on the system and then then use it to send this car and share things in real time transition during information transition during information during real time .
4119 G= now , today , you need , if you want to win a race , in actually monit@@ or something like this here -- something that wa@@ kes in real time , a thousand sensor@@ s , the information from the car , on this information and apply it to this car and putting it into this car and colle@@ cting things in real time and colle@@ cting things in real time and colle@@ cting things in real time .
5144 T= so a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o previ@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan .
5144 H= so in a survey that i done with sing@@ le-@@ o-@@ gas@@ ol@@ ar@@ conser@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ r@@ o ter@@ ter@@ o 193@@ ter@@ o , we &apos;ve made a study with the people at ring -- employees all worked for ring -- and these humans were all fund@@ ed in a colle@@ ction that volunte@@ ered their participa@@ tion to their reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ings for their reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ance plan for their reti@@ re@@ ment plan for their reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ acy plan .
5144 G= so we &apos;ve done in a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o &apos;s ter@@ o , we &apos;ve made a study with the people at ing -- -- and these people were all emplo@@ yed in a colle@@ ction colle@@ ction in which they sig@@ ned their participa@@ tion for their reti@@ re@@ ment plan .
260 T= and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for decisi@@ on-@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
260 H= the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &apos; patients &apos; patients &quot; patients &quot; . that sounds like a good thing , but reality is a shift load of responsibility for affect someone who knows something -- nam@@ ely the doctor doctor -- nam@@ ely the doctor -- nam@@ ely the doctor doctor knows , and that is why not hit the best , and therefore isn &apos;t the best const@@ it@@ ution is a decision to express -- nam@@ ision the patient .
260 G= the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonom@@ y , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but reality is a shift of the choo@@ sing decisions of someone who knows -- nam@@ ely the do@@ tor -- nam@@ ely from the do@@ tor -- somebody who knows nothing and the highest ill is a decision -- nam@@ ely in the best const@@ it@@ ution is a decision -- nam@@ ely the patient .
612 T= they believed that a geni@@ us was this , sort of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like do@@ bby the house el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of invisi@@ bly as@@ s@@ ist the artist with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
612 H= she believed that an geni@@ us was this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ vin@@ cent beings believed that literally literally literally auth@@ ori@@ zed that literally literally literally lives living in the walls living one studio studio artist -- about such as do@@ ast , the dom@@ el 11 -- the ki@@ ck , and artists in work was virtu@@ ably invisible invisi@@ ble and achie@@ ved the out@@ come of labor , and achie@@ ved the out@@ come of labor .
612 G= they believed that a geni@@ us believed that a geni@@ us of this kind of ma@@ gical go@@ tt@@ able creatures , that literally in the w@@ fe@@ es of an artist at@@ eli@@ ers -- about as do@@ bby , the house of the house -- the out@@ come -- the out of the work , and the artist in the work was in the work , and the result of the work .
678 T= this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of p@@ its of des@@ pair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
678 H= and this idea was saved me as i was in the mid@@ st of the journalist , practice , practice , and i fell in a this cru@@ de of the dou@@ rock of the dou@@ bt of the rock that we all fall when we work at something and it becomes not going to work , and it becomes a disaster , which is ever written .
678 G= this idea , when i was in the middle of the des@@ cen@@ ding process of , pra@@ y , pra@@ y , love . i fell in one of these gr@@ u@@ bes of the two rock els in which we all drop , if we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start to think that it becomes a des@@ aster . that &apos;s the worst book that has been written .
1996 T= we also brought one of these dies@@ el ag@@ gre@@ gates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the dies@@ el is behind it , here &apos;s the big battery , here are all the conver@@ ters , with which we simu@@ late the network .
1996 H= we also have one of this dies@@ -@@ agen@@ cy in the same scale as it stands up in the hall in the hall in the hall , actually the complete dynamic behaviors from this grid , so in the hall here , there is the big battery here , here is the big battery here , here the big battery here , here is the big battery here , here is the big battery here where we simu@@ late that grid with .
1996 G= we also have one of these the same ag@@ gre@@ gate in the same size , which he put there , in the hall , in fact , in the hall , so in the hall , so in the back here , there is this back here , there &apos;s the big bat@@ ter@@ y , here &apos;s the great bat@@ ter@@ y , here &apos;s the big bat@@ ter@@ y , which we simul@@ late the network .
2284 T= if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
2284 H= and if i &apos;m today , if i want to come close to you is that the total ful@@ ness of data we consu@@ me , bigger than sum total of your pieces and instead of thinking information about information as we can use information such as we can use information such as we can use information and we recognize so trends recogni@@ zes patterns that recogni@@ zes otherwise impossible couldn &apos;t seem otherwise visible .
2284 G= if i want to give you one thing today is that the colle@@ ction of the data that we consu@@ me , greater than the sum of their individual parts and instead of over@@ load of information over@@ load , and instead of thinking about information as we use information so we can use information so we can use information so that the pattern that would otherwise become visible .
3940 T= so what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science goes , the more we have to ad@@ mit to ourselves that these categ@@ ories that we thought of as stable an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that ma@@ pped very simply to stable identity categ@@ ories are a lot more fu@@ zz@@ y than we thought .
3940 H= so we &apos;ve moved so such a situation where , ever continu@@ ed our process of continu@@ ing to stand up such that these categ@@ ories we held for rob@@ i@@ le atoms theor@@ ies which had given very simple or@@ der@@ ability to create perman@@ sive identity er@@ adi@@ cation uni@@ qu@@ eness to create perman@@ sive identity explan@@ ations , are much un@@ sh@@ anno@@ yed than we have as@@ sum@@ ed .
3940 G= so , we have so a situation where , depen@@ ding on our science , and we have to deal with more and more , that these categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve given for stable an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories , which were very simple ingre@@ di@@ ents , which are very simple ingre@@ di@@ ents in const@@ ant iden@@ tical identi@@ ties , when we suppose .
15 T= no bi@@ ologists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ario in the real@@ m of biological diversity -- sc@@ arc@@ ely approach@@ es what we know to be the most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ario in the real@@ m of cultural diversity .
15 H= no g@@ biolog@@ ist , no g@@ biolog@@ ist , for example , is that 50 percent or more of any species extin@@ ct soon before extin@@ ction , because it just isn &apos;t right , and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ ti@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ arian scen@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ arian diversity -- equivalent to what known as most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ ari@@ ari@@ zation around cultural diversity in cultural diversity .
15 G= no bi@@ ologist wouldn &apos;t say that 50 percent or more of all species , is that 50 percent or more of all species , because it &apos;s easy not agre@@ ed , and yet , this -- the pharma@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic s@@ cen@@ ari@@ um on the field of biological diversity -- almost none of which , what &apos;s known as optimi@@ stic s@@ cen@@ ari@@ um on the field of cultural diversity .
183 T= the computer vision algorith@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken near gras@@ s@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . so you see elements here of stabili@@ zed sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been related spa@@ tially .

3528 T= the human ability to ada@@ pt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have contin@@ ually wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity , and i &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : this phr@@ ase never sat right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
3528 H= the human ability to ada@@ pt -- that &apos;s a very exciting story , because humans always me ask me about how i surro@@ um@@ ed with fun skills and i &apos;m going to be standing for me : this phr@@ ase has never fit for me forever , and i kept feeling very un@@ comfortable asking me to answer the questions of humans to answer me , and i believe , i understand why .
3528 G= the human ability to ada@@ pt , which is a really interesting story , because people are always asking to ask about how i deal with wi@@ dri@@ ties , and i &apos;ll give you something conf@@ essed , and i &apos;m going to show you something , and i &apos;ve always felt quite un@@ comfortable with the questions of people to answer them , and i don &apos;t think why .
4319 T= so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for temp@@ t to control a las@@ er and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be a@@ wes@@ ome . &quot;
4319 H= so i went home and ate her wife with my wife and obs@@ essed her of everything and we thought , &quot; now , second times when there can use these technologies that can use his eyes to control things , then we should need a path to control things , then we should need a path to drive things , so it can be able to make sure that it can be free again . &quot;
4319 G= so i went home and a@@ ute with my wife , and he told her of everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there are these technology , with the man &apos;s eyes , then you should be able to use a way to do things , we should find a way to try and do a las@@ er , so that it would be cool . &quot;
603 T= and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the in@@ her@@ ent emotional risks of creativity .
603 H= while over the past year year for models for models for models for doing that , i also immer@@ sed in the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see other societies around to see whether it may better better or sensi@@ ble ideas about what you can serve crea@@ tively better or sensi@@ ble ideas about how to serve creative crea@@ tives with creativity connected to creativity creativity associated creativity with creativity associated with creativity creativity associated creativity with creativity .
603 G= while i sat down in the past year , to model that , i &apos;ve heal@@ ed in the past year , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies , to see if you might be perhaps better or sensi@@ ble ideas about how to be creative ideas about how to be creative risks , with the emotional risks , which is connected to creativity .
937 T= that here is bio@@ curious , the ha@@ cker@@ space i mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education cent@@ re for for molecular biology .
937 H= here at the bottom here , you see is this laboratory at demon@@ stration , so so a sig@@ ned garage garage with also such great labor@@ at@@ ary du@@ tter , which has bri@@ bed the university of university , which has a group in paris which lies there and has pretty interesting stuff , so i also is doing pretty interesting things , so i want to do something very interesting stuff , because there &apos;s also pretty interesting stuff , because there &apos;s also pretty interesting stuff , so i also make a project a project in short , so , so , there &apos;s also a project in paris , so there &apos;s this laboratory at the bottom here , so you see , this is laboratory at the bottom here , so , so there &apos;s so a zu@@ engine@@ ered garage with also such great labor@@ at@@ ter@@ ed lab here , so this is a sig@@ ned garage garage with also so anything kind of lab@@ el@@ ed garage with also so all kinds of kinds of labor@@ at@@ ories , so this is kind of an employe@@ ed garage with also ,
937 G= here at the bottom in the picture , this is the lab , in an@@ leadership , so it &apos;s such a garage garage with also so all sorts of lab sm@@ ack , which has taken the un@@ i , a group in paris which has been dis@@ gu@@ sted , a group in paris that has consi@@ der@@ ed and quite quite interesting things , because it wants to do quite quite interesting things , because it doesn &apos;t do quite quite interesting things , because there is a project short .
1079 T= and has nothing more to do with reality .
1079 H= bru@@ ce brown , a well-@@ known design resear@@ cher at the british audi@@ o university , is so bro@@ ad to pleas@@ ed that media media , he thinks the book and the image , so it doesn &apos;t television television and so forth , what we consider as a mass media preser@@ ves our memory and our ability to virtual virtual media our memory and our ability to virtual virtual open@@ ness and our capacity to virtual virtual open@@ ness and our ability to virtual virtual auth@@ ority .
1079 G= bru@@ ce brown , a famous designer at british university at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , is so far , that this mass media , he meant that this mass media , he meant that the book and the picture , so on the web , so on , what we be@@ gun as a mass media today , that this mass media of our memory is fossi@@ led .
2683 T= and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the nega@@ tives , which are essentially the radiation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
2683 H= and therefore , there &apos;s various , but the beauty part is that a molecule has energy energy energy has twice as much energy as a , say , let us say a ko@@ lo@@ molecule molecule and therefore , when they can deal with problems and the costs , the potential , and the cost is potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in one own pur@@ g@@ a , and other things , almost in one pur@@ g@@ a .
2683 G= and so there &apos;s different , but the beautiful part is that a big molecule has a million times as much energy like a , we say , a molecule molecule , and that , if you deal with the problems and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the foot@@ print and the costs , does the potential , does the potential to do the country , and other things , almost in a own li@@ g@@ a .
3521 T= now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exer@@ cis@@ es i didn &apos;t want to do before the pro@@ spe@@ ct of being the rich@@ est five-@@ year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an awful daily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and promis@@ ing experience for me .
3521 H= of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. embar@@ ke@@ p , which i didn &apos;t want to make the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the sight that suff@@ i@@ cient five year-old girl in the hospital in the second ve four , but he actually taught me to see my daily practice hor@@ ter@@ ror with new eyes , so that became become a new and intri@@ gu@@ promis@@ ed experience .
3521 G= that was , of course , was just a simpl@@ er trick trick that i did not do , with the ex@@ view , that rich@@ est fif@@ -year-old girls in the clin@@ station in the patient station in the patient station in the second hi@@ station . but he actually actually led to see my daily usual hor@@ ror hor@@ ror with new eyes . so it &apos;s got a new and diver@@ gent fac@@ tion of the experience .
3529 T= impli@@ c@@ it in this phr@@ ase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challen@@ ging experience uns@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ de@@ step or circum@@ navi@@ gate the pres@@ um@@ ed pit@@ falls of a life with pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics , or what other people percei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
3529 H= and of course that this set of res@@ um@@ on@@ ation of the notion that success or happiness depen@@ ds to master a challenge to ma@@ sters a challenge to ma@@ sters a challenge of bri@@ sters , without being pra@@ ined so successful , because i could avoid possible fall of life with a pro@@ thesis of pro@@ thesis of pro@@ thesis of pro@@ thesis or how humans humans can percei@@ ve me with my dis@@ ability with my dis@@ abilities with my dis@@ ability .
3529 G= this sentence from the transition with wi@@ dri@@ ties , from the idea that success or happiness depen@@ ds on the idea that success or happiness , without depen@@ ding on the so ambi@@ ent experience . when if my life would be so successful , because i could de@@ vote the potential of a life with a pro@@ s@@ thetic way , or how even people percei@@ ve with my dis@@ order .
4582 T= that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corpo@@ ration , for@@ -@@ profit or non-@@ profit , was going to get the on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ lifetime opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a ti@@ tle , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hin@@ t as to what the subject matter would actually be .
4582 H= really , a few happ@@ ier people and companies , require prof@@ prof@@ it@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit profit , the unique opportunity -- because i am sure that chris ander@@ son won won not allow that again -- buying the nam@@ ens@@ rights rights to buy the speech she just saw , which was not given a ti@@ tle and not there had been a lot of content and not spent a lot of what that top@@ ic was going to be a lot of what that top@@ ic was going .
4582 G= really , some happy individuals , and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit , the lon@@ ger@@ -@@ profit opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will access to the talk , the nam@@ i@@ rights rights on the talk , the name is right now , who didn &apos;t have a ti@@ tle of what the top@@ ic was actually going to have a ti@@ tle of that top@@ ic .
6322 T= and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a cal@@ tech student , it was a person from england , from man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who , during the day , was an ex@@ ecu@@ tive assi@@ stant at a re@@ hab clin@@ ic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein fol@@ der .
6322 H= and as those individuals came and looked and watching who is the best prot@@ oni@@ ler of world is this , no professor professor , no cal@@ tech student , it was someone from u.k. , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who held daily than assi@@ st@@ enti@@ n in an rec@@ ru@@ b hospital in a rec@@ ru@@ b hospital and night was been the best net unit and night was the best piece of proteins in the world .

909 T= and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from syn@@ thetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstra@@ ct code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like a computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s material , i mean real material , and not just cyber@@ ne@@ tic .
909 H= it &apos;s now just increasing biology in biology now , and this is where i want this metaphor that depen@@ ds coming from syn@@ thetic tic biology , take , that biology is actually is an informa@@ tional code , which is , which is an an more more abstra@@ ct of the computer , because it is matter because biology is matter because biology is matter because biology is matter because biology is matter because biology is matter because biology is matter , and isn &apos;t just cy@@ ber .
909 G= and now , in the way , in the way , and since i want to take this metaphor , which is syn@@ thetic biology comes , suppose that biology is actually a source science , because , the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a code is a abstra@@ ct code , the yes , it &apos;s not quite equal as computers , because it &apos;s a matter , because it &apos;s a matter , because it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s a matter , because it &apos;s not just cy@@ ber .
