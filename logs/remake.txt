you know , one of the great things about traveling , and one of the jo@@ ys of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is to live together with the people who can still remember the old days . who still feel their past in the wind , touch them on sto@@ nes smo@@ othe@@ d by the rain , taste them in the bit@@ ter leaves of the plants . 
simply knowing that ja@@ gu@@ ar sha@@ man@@ s still travel beyond the mil@@ ky way , or that the meaning of the my@@ ths of the ol@@ dest of the in@@ u@@ it are still full of signific@@ ance , or that in him@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as the budd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the breath of d@@ har@@ ma , is the central reve@@ lation of anthropo@@ log@@ y it is the thought that the world in which we live does not exist in an absolute sense , but only as a model of reality , as a consequ@@ ence of a group of certain possibilities of adap@@ tation that our own , though successful , call to mind , many generations ago . 
and of course we all share the same ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ment needs . 
we are all born . we bring children to the world . 
we go through initi@@ ation ritu@@ als . 
we have to deal with the ine@@ x@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , and th@@ us we should not be surprised that we all sing , dance and produce art . 
but interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture . 
it does not matter whether it &apos;s the pen@@ an in the bor@@ ne@@ o fore@@ sts , or the vo@@ od@@ o@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the desert of the north of kenya , the cur@@ ander@@ os in the and@@ es , or a car@@ a@@ van@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the jung@@ le sahar@@ a . this happened to be the collea@@ gue with whom i travel@@ ed to the desert a month ago . or even a y@@ ak@@ -@@ she@@ pher@@ d on the slo@@ pes of the q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ d@@ mother of the world . 
all of these people teach us that there are other exist@@ enti@@ al possibilities , different ways of thinking , different ways of ori@@ entation on earth . 
and that is an idea that , if you think about it , can only ful@@ fill you with hope . 
together , the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world form a network of spiritu@@ al and cultural life that en@@ vel@@ ops the earth and for which earth is just as important as the bio@@ sphere network known as the bio@@ sphere . 
one can imagine this cultural life network as an eth@@ no@@ sphere . the eth@@ no@@ sphere can be defined as the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths ideas , inspi@@ ration@@ s , and intui@@ tions that have been produced by the human imagination since the beginn@@ ings of consciousness . 
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity . 
it is the symbol of all that we are and what we are capable of as ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ingly in@@ qui@@ si@@ tive species . 
and just as the bio@@ sphere was hea@@ vil@@ y ero@@ ded , so did the eth@@ no@@ sphere - only at an even faster rate . 
for example , no biolog@@ ist would dar@@ e cla@@ im that 50@@ % or more of all species are about to die out because it just is not true . yet , this - the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ario in the field of bio@@ diversity - hard@@ ly cor@@ respon@@ ds to what we know to be the most optimis@@ tic scen@@ ario in the field of cultural diversity . 
and the deci@@ ding indi@@ cat@@ or is the extin@@ ction of the languages . 
when each of them was born in this room , 6@@ 000 languages were spo@@ ken on the earth . 
now a language is not just the tot@@ ality of the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ mati@@ cal rules . 
a language is an expression of the human mind . 
it is a means by which the sou@@ l of a particular culture fin@@ ds access to the material world . 
every language is like an old forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritu@@ al possibilities . 
and of these 6@@ ,000 languages , today , while we &apos;re sitting here in mon@@ ter@@ ey , exactly half of them are no longer whi@@ sper@@ ing in the ear@@ s of children . 
they are no longer taught to@@ dd@@ ler@@ s . that is , if nothing is done , they are actually already dead . 
what could be lon@@ eli@@ er than being sh@@ rou@@ ded in sil@@ ence , being one of the last of your people to speak your language , having no opportunity to pass on the wisdom of ance@@ stors , or hop@@ ing for childr@@ en@@ ? 
and yet , this terrible fa@@ te actually happens to someone somewhere on the earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older person dies and takes the last syl@@ lab@@ les of an ancient language with him into the gra@@ ve . 
and i know that some of them say , &quot; is not that better ? &quot; would not the world be a better place if we all spoke one language on@@ ly@@ ? &quot; and i say : &quot; well , let that language be yor@@ u@@ ba . let her be can@@ ton@@ ese . 
let her be kog@@ i . &quot; 
and then you would suddenly realize what it would be like if you could not speak your own language . 
that &apos;s why i &apos;d like to take them on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a short journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to make them understand what has actually been lost . 
now there are some among us who somehow forget that when i say &quot; different possibilities of being &quot; really different ways of being mine . 
take , for example , this child of bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west of ama@@ zon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da , who believe that my@@ tho@@ logi@@ cally they came up the flow of milk from the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red ser@@ pen@@ ts . 
this is a people that does not cogni@@ tively distin@@ gui@@ sh between the colors blue and green , as the hea@@ ven@@ ly tent is equal to the forest on which the humans depen@@ d . 
they have a strange language and marriage pres@@ cri@@ ption called lin@@ gui@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y@@ : you have to mar@@ ry someone who speak@@ s another language . 
all this is roo@@ ted in the my@@ th@@ ological past . the pe@@ cul@@ i@@ ari@@ ty of these large houses , which speak six or seven languages ​​due to the mix@@ ed language , is that you never hear anyone who lear@@ ns a language . 
they just listen and then start talking . 
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i have ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i in nor@@ the@@ astern ecu@@ ad@@ or , an amazing people that was first pe@@ ac@@ efully cont@@ ac@@ ted in 195@@ 8 . 
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries tried to make contact and made a gra@@ ve mistake . 
they thre@@ w glo@@ ss@@ y photos of themselves out of the air , which we would rate as a friend@@ ly gest@@ ure . they for@@ got that these people from the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives . 
they picked up these photographs of the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the figure , found nothing and conclu@@ ded that these were business cards of the de@@ vil and killed the five mis@@ sion@@ aries with the spea@@ r . 
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i not only killed out@@ si@@ ders with the spea@@ r . 
they pie@@ r@@ ced each other . 
5@@ 4@@ % of dea@@ ths occur@@ red through dri@@ ll@@ ing . 
we tra@@ ced the gene@@ alo@@ g@@ y back eight generations and found two cases of natural death and when we asked people about it vi@@ gor@@ ously , they ad@@ mitt@@ ed that one of the people had grown so old that he died because of his age and we killed him anyway the spea@@ r . 
but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forest , which was amazing . 
their hun@@ ters could smell the ur@@ ine of an animal from 40 pac@@ es distance and determin@@ e which species of animal it belo@@ n@@ ged to . 
in the early 198@@ 0s , i got a really amazing job when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and infi@@ l@@ tra@@ ting the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of du@@ val@@ ier and ton@@ ton ma@@ cou@@ tes and that po@@ ison used to make zo@@ m@@ bie@@ s . 
of course , to make sense of this sen@@ sation , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of vo@@ dou@@ n , and vo@@ od@@ o@@ o is not a cul@@ t of black magic . 
on the contra@@ ry , it is a complex meta@@ physical world@@ view . 
it is interesting . 
if i asked them to en@@ um@@ er@@ ate the great world religi@@ ons , what would they sa@@ y@@ ? 
christ@@ i@@ ani@@ ty , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , jud@@ a@@ ism or whatever . 
a continent is always left out because the assu@@ mption was that there was no religious belief in black africa . of course there was one and vo@@ od@@ o@@ o is simply the re@@ m@@ nant of these very profound religious thoughts that came over during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ very . 
but what makes vo@@ od@@ o@@ o so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead . 
the living give birth to the spir@@ its . 
the spir@@ its can be con@@ ju@@ red up from under the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhyth@@ m of the dance , to tempor@@ arily dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the living , so that the ak@@ oly@@ th becomes god for a brief , shi@@ ning moment . 
des@@ hab , the vo@@ od@@ o@@ o@@ ists like to say , &quot; you white go to church and talk about god . 
we dance in the temp@@ le and become go@@ ds . &quot; 
and because you are pos@@ s@@ essed , you are taken by the mind . how can you be har@@ me@@ d@@ ? 
you see these amazing demon@@ stra@@ tion@@ s@@ : vo@@ od@@ o@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in a tran@@ ce state , tou@@ ching the glo@@ wing coal without burning , an amazing view of the mind &apos;s ability to influence the body to end@@ ure the body when put into a state of extreme exc@@ it@@ ement . 
well , of all the people i met , the kog@@ i from the sie@@ r@@ ra ne@@ va@@ da de san@@ ta mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia were the most extraordinary . 
des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of the ancient ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal civilization that popul@@ ated the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of col@@ om@@ bia , and as a result of con@@ que@@ st , this people re@@ treated into an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massi@@ f ris@@ ing above the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in . 
in a blo@@ od@@ -@@ sta@@ ined continent , these people were the only ones never con@@ que@@ red by the span@@ i@@ ards . 
to this day , they are rul@@ ed by a ritual pri@@ est@@ hood . however , training for the pri@@ est@@ hood is very extraordinary . 
at the age of three and four , the young ac@@ oly@@ tes are separ@@ ated from their families and lo@@ cked up in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ kn@@ ess , in stone hu@@ ts at the foot of the gla@@ ci@@ er for 18 years . two nin@@ e-@@ year peri@@ ods , pur@@ pos@@ ely cho@@ sen to mi@@ mic the nine months of preg@@ nan@@ cy they spent in the wom@@ b of their birth mother , they now spend meta@@ mor@@ pho@@ se@@ dly in the wom@@ b of their great mother . 
and throughout this time , they are cul@@ tur@@ ally introduced to the values ​​of their society . values ​​that main@@ tain the cla@@ im that their pra@@ yers and only their pra@@ yers , the co@@ sm@@ ic - or we could say the ec@@ ological - balance are main@@ tain@@ ed . 
at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they are suddenly taken outside and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in this cr@@ y@@ sta@@ l clear moment of awareness of the first light , when the sun begins to shi@@ ne on the slo@@ pes of the ama@@ z@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything that you have learned in the abstra@@ ct is confi@@ r@@ med in ast@@ on@@ ishing sp@@ len@@ do@@ r . and the pri@@ est steps back and says , &quot; you see , it &apos;s really how i told you . 
it is so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot; 
they call themselves the older brothers and say that we , the yo@@ unger brothers , are responsible for the destruction of the world . 
now this level of intuition becomes very important . 
whenever we think of indi@@ geno@@ us and landscape , we con@@ ju@@ re up either rou@@ ss@@ e@@ au and the old ru@@ mor of the no@@ ble sav@@ age , which in its simpli@@ fication is a ra@@ cis@@ t thought or , on the other hand , tho@@ re@@ au and say these people are more connected with nature than we . 
th@@ us , indi@@ geno@@ us people are nei@@ ther sent@@ i@@ mental nor are they wea@@ ken@@ ed by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a . 
there is not much room for it in the %malaria-infested mar@@ she@@ s of as@@ ma@@ t or the cold wind@@ s of ti@@ bet , but they ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , through time and ritual , have formed a myster@@ i@@ ous ni@@ m@@ bus of the earth , which is not based on the idea of ​​being consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far more sub@@ tle intuition , the idea that the earth in itself can exist only because it is in@@ hal@@ ed into human consciousness . 
well , what does that mean@@ ? 
it means that a little child from the other who grow@@ s up in the belief that the mountain is an ap@@ u-@@ spirit who will determin@@ e his or her fa@@ te will become a totally different person , and another relationship to that resource or place as a little kid from mon@@ tan@@ a who grow@@ s up belie@@ ving that a mountain is a hea@@ p of sto@@ nes that can be wor@@ n away . 
whether he is a abo@@ de of a mind or a hea@@ p is ir@@ relevant . 
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and nature . 
i grew up in the fore@@ sts of british colum@@ bia and believed that these fore@@ sts are there to be clear@@ ed . 
this made me a different person from my k@@ wa@@ ki@@ u@@ t@@ l friends , who believe that these fore@@ sts are the abo@@ de of hu@@ ku@@ k and the ben@@ t sky@@ -@@ be@@ ak and the can@@ ni@@ ba@@ l spir@@ its that live on the north end of the world , gh@@ ost@@ s that they have at their ham@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation would participa@@ te . 
now , when you start to consider the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . for example this plant here . 
it is a photo that i took only last ap@@ ri@@ l in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon . 
this is a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , many of whom have heard of it , the most poten@@ t psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation from the repe@@ r@@ toi@@ re of the sha@@ man . 
what makes a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca so fascinating is not just the pharma@@ c@@ ological potential of this prepar@@ ation , but its process@@ ing . it is really made from two different sources . on the one hand , there is this woo@@ den li@@ ana , which holds a series of bet@@ ac@@ arb@@ oli@@ nes , har@@ mi@@ n , har@@ mol@@ in , slightly hallu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic . taking this clim@@ ber alone is like having a blue clou@@ dy smo@@ ke on her mind , but it is bl@@ ended with the leaves of a sh@@ ru@@ b from the family of coffee plants called psycho@@ tri@@ a vir@@ i@@ di@@ s . 
this plant con@@ tains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines which are very similar to ser@@ ot@@ oni@@ n , %dimethyltryptamine-5 and %methoxydimethyltryptamine . 
if you have ever seen the y@@ an@@ om@@ ami s@@ nu@@ ff@@ ing this stuff , this substan@@ ce that you make from different species also con@@ tains %methoxydimethyltryptamine . 
s@@ nu@@ ff@@ ing this po@@ w@@ der is like being shot at from a gun bar@@ re@@ l , surro@@ unded by bar@@ o@@ que paint@@ ings and land@@ ing on a sea of ​​electricity . 
it does not produce a dist@@ or@@ tion of reality , but the dis@@ solution of reality . 
i even discus@@ sed it with my professor , richard ev@@ an shu@@ l@@ tes , the man who initi@@ ated the psych@@ ed@@ eli@@ c era with the discovery of magic mush@@ rooms in mexico in the 193@@ 0s . i cla@@ im@@ ed that one could not classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hallu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic , because the moment you feel the effects , you are no longer there to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ation . 
but the thing with tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is that they can not be taken or@@ ally because they are den@@ atur@@ ed by a naturally occur@@ ring enzy@@ me in the human inte@@ stin@@ e called mon@@ o@@ amin@@ e ox@@ i@@ das@@ e . 
they can only be taken or@@ ally in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemicals that den@@ ature the ma@@ o . 
now the intri@@ gu@@ ing thing is that the bet@@ a-@@ carb@@ oli@@ nes con@@ tain@@ ed in the li@@ ana are ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of exactly the kind necessary to poten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines . so ask yourself . 
how can these people find from a flo@@ ra of 8@@ 0,000 species of ast@@ ring@@ ent plants these two mor@@ pho@@ logi@@ cally un@@ related plants that , when combin@@ ed in this way , create a kind of bio@@ chemical version so that the whole is greater than the sum of its part@@ s@@ ? 
we use this great eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ m , trial and er@@ ror , which turns out to be meaning@@ less . 
but if you ask the indi@@ ans they sa@@ y@@ : &quot; the plant speak@@ s to us &quot; 
so , what does that mean@@ ? 
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 vari@@ et@@ ies of a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , which they all recognize at great di@@ stances in the forest , which appear as a species to our eyes . 
and then you ask them how to justi@@ fy their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; i thought you understood plan@@ ting . 
i mean , do not you know any@@ thin@@ g@@ ? &quot; and i said : &quot; no . &quot; 
so , it turns out that you take each of the 17 vari@@ ants at full moon and they sing to one in a different pit@@ ch . 
well , that does not bring you a doc@@ tor@@ al degree in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count as stam@@ ina . 
well , the problem - the problem is that even those of us who symp@@ ath@@ ize with the difficult situation of the indi@@ geno@@ us people see them as original and color@@ ful , but somehow confi@@ ne them to the past while the real world , i . e . our world , pro@@ gr@@ esses . 
so , the fact is that you will not remember the tw@@ enti@@ eth century or 300 years of war or technological innovation , but rather an era in which we were present and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet either activ@@ ely suppor@@ ted or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted . so the problem is not the change . 
all cultures have repe@@ ate@@ dly participa@@ ted in the dance with new opportunities for life . 
and the problem is not the technology itself . 
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ ou@@ x as they bow@@ ed and dar@@ ted when the americans ce@@ ased to be americans when they qui@@ t horse and horse wa@@ go@@ n . 
no change and technology thre@@ aten the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it is power . the ug@@ ly face of the rei@@ g@@ n . 
and where@@ ver you look in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not do@@ ome@@ d . these are dynam@@ ically living peop@@ les whose existence is super@@ se@@ ded by recogni@@ za@@ ble forces that go beyond their capacity for adap@@ tation . whether this is the mon@@ stro@@ us de@@ fore@@ station in the home@@ land of the pen@@ an , a nom@@ adi@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , from sar@@ aw@@ ak , a people who lived free in the forest a generation ago , and has now been de@@ gra@@ ded to bon@@ da@@ ge and pro@@ stit@@ ution on the river bank , from where they see that even the river is pollu@@ ted with the mu@@ d , which almost half bor@@ ne@@ o seems to swe@@ ep away into the south chinese sea . from where the japanese frei@@ ght@@ ers can be seen on the hori@@ zon , ready to fill their ship &apos;s rooms with ra@@ w tree tru@@ n@@ ks that they have wr@@ est@@ ed from the forest . or as in the case of the y@@ an@@ om@@ ami , where it is disease car@@ rie@@ rs that were introduced during the gold rus@@ h . 
or if we go to the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i am doing a lot of research again , you will see the ug@@ ly face of political domin@@ ation . 
you know , the geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of people is generally con@@ dem@@ ned , but the eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of people &apos;s lives , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , but celebra@@ ted in general and in many places as part of a development strategy . 
and you can not understand the suffering of ti@@ bet if you have not experienced it at the lo@@ west level . 
i once travel@@ ed with a young collea@@ gue 6@@ 000 miles from chen@@ g@@ du in western china through sou@@ the@@ ast ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a and only when i came to l@@ has@@ a i saw the face behind the statistics of which one hea@@ rs . 6@@ 000 sac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents , which were turned into ru@@ b@@ ble and ash@@ es . 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the ca@@ dre@@ s during the cultural revolution . 
the father of this young man was identifi@@ ed as a follo@@ wer of the pan@@ chen lam@@ a . 
that meant he was killed immediately during the chinese invasi@@ on . 
his un@@ cle fle@@ d with her hol@@ iness into the di@@ as@@ por@@ a , which brought people to ne@@ pa@@ l . 
his mother was imp@@ ris@@ oned as a pun@@ ish@@ ment for being weal@@ thy for crime . 
he was sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed into prison at the age of two to hi@@ de under her ski@@ rt because she could not live without him . 
the sister who did this val@@ i@@ ant act was taken to an education center . 
one day she ste@@ pped on a bra@@ cele@@ t ma@@ os and for this trans@@ gressi@@ on she had to go to a heavy labor camp for seven years . 
the suffering of ti@@ bet can be unbe@@ arab@@ le , but the saving spirit of the people is something un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able . 
and in the end we are really face@@ d with a choice . do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diver@@ si@@ ty@@ ? 
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ logi@@ st said before she died that it is her greatest fear that as we move towards a thre@@ ad@@ bare , form@@ less , gener@@ ic world@@ view , we would not only see the full range of human imagination redu@@ ced to a nar@@ ro@@ wed min@@ d@@ set , but that one day we wake up from a dream , for@@ getting that there ever was any other possibility . 
and it is hum@@ ili@@ ating to think that our genu@@ s may have exist@@ ed for 6@@ 00@@ ,000 years . 
the ne@@ oli@@ thi@@ c revolution that brought agriculture to us and at that moment subje@@ cted us to the cul@@ t of the see@@ d , re@@ placed the sha@@ man &apos;s poetry with the pro@@ sa@@ ic pro@@ sa@@ ic and created hier@@ arch@@ y , speci@@ alization and sur@@ plus - took place only 10,000 years ago . 
the modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old . 
well , this super@@ ficial story does not tell me that we all have answers to the challenges we face in the coming mil@@ len@@ nia . 
when we ask these coun@@ t@@ less world cultures for the meaning of humanity , they answer with 10,000 different voices . 
and in this song , we will re@@ discover the possibility of being who we are@@ : people with full awareness , who are aware of the importance of ens@@ uring that all people and gar@@ dens can pro@@ spe@@ r . and there are great moments of optimis@@ m . 
here &apos;s a picture i took at the northern end of the ba@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands , when i went to nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with in@@ u@@ its . and this man , ol@@ a@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father . 
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always hand@@ led the in@@ u@@ it very well , and during the 195@@ 0s , in the wake of the establi@@ sh@@ ment of our rule , they were forced to move to sett@@ le@@ ments . 
the grand@@ father of this old man re@@ fu@@ sed . 
the family , who was afraid for his life , took away all his weapons and tools . 
now you must know that the in@@ u@@ it are not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage . 
the slide ra@@ ils of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made from fish wra@@ pped in car@@ ib@@ o@@ u skin . 
the man &apos;s grand@@ father was not afraid of the arc@@ tic night or the blo@@ wing stor@@ m . 
he sli@@ pped out , lo@@ wer@@ ing his ski@@ ns from se@@ al@@ skin and de@@ fe@@ cat@@ ing into his hand . and when the fa@@ ec@@ es began to free@@ ze , he sha@@ ped them into the shape of a kni@@ fe . 
he spra@@ yed sal@@ i@@ va on the sides of the fa@@ ec@@ es kni@@ fe and when it was completely fro@@ zen he stab@@ bed a dog with it . 
he sk@@ inn@@ ed the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the skelet@@ on of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a sle@@ dge , ho@@ ok@@ ed another dog and disappe@@ ared over the ice flo@@ es with the fe@@ ces kni@@ fe on his bel@@ t . 
so you can not do anything from nothing . 
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resi@@ stance of the in@@ u@@ it and of the indi@@ geno@@ us people of the world . 
in ap@@ ri@@ l 199@@ 9 , the can@@ adi@@ an government gave the in@@ u@@ it full control of an area larger than california and texas combin@@ ed . 
it is our new home@@ land and is called nu@@ na@@ v@@ ut . 
it is an independent area . they control all miner@@ al de@@ posi@@ ts . 
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , can see@@ k and achieve repar@@ ation with its in@@ habit@@ ants . 
and , in the end , i believe , it is quite obvious , at least to those of us who have travel@@ ed to these dist@@ ant dest@@ in@@ ations of the earth , to realize that they are not at all remote . 
they are someone &apos;s home@@ land . 
they represent parts of the human imagination that go back in time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope . 
what we at national geographic end up trying to do is believe that politicians never achieve anything . 
we believe that pol@@ em@@ ic - we believe pol@@ em@@ ic is not convin@@ cing , but we believe that story@@ telling can change the world , and th@@ us we are probably the best institution for story@@ telling in the world . our website gets 35 million hits every month . 
15@@ 6 nations send our tv chan@@ nel . 
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions . 
and we under@@ take a series of tri@@ ps to the eth@@ no@@ sphere , where we take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they are blin@@ ded by the sight . and hopefully , one by one , they will assu@@ me the central reve@@ lation of anthropo@@ log@@ y@@ : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in different ways , that we can find a way of life in a truly multi@@ cultural , plu@@ ra@@ li@@ stic world , where wisdom is shared by all people can contribu@@ te to our mu@@ tual well-@@ being . 
many thanks . 
what i will show you first , as soon as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have hand@@ ed over to microsoft as part of an ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion exactly one year ago . that &apos;s se@@ ad@@ ra@@ go@@ n . and it &apos;s an environment where you can hand@@ le huge amo@@ unts of visual data , either lo@@ cally or re@@ mot@@ ely . 
we see many , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here that can be se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ally fe@@ t@@ ched , pan@@ ned , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ged in any way . 
and it does not matter how much information we look at , how big these colle@@ ctions are or how big the pictures are . 
most of them are digital camera photos , but this one is for example a scan of the con@@ gress library and it is in a range of 300 me@@ ga@@ pi@@ x@@ els . 
it makes no difference , because the only thing that can lim@@ it the performance of a system like this is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen every moment . it also has a very flexi@@ ble architecture . 
this is a whole book , an example of non-@@ image data . 
this is ble@@ ak house by dic@@ ken@@ s . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter . 
to prove that it is really a text , not a picture , we can do something like that to really show that it is a true repres@@ entation of the text , not a picture . 
maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-@@ book . 
i would not re@@ comm@@ end it . 
this is a more reali@@ stic case . this is an edi@@ tion of the guar@@ di@@ an . 
every big picture is the beginning of a section . 
and that really gives them the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real paper edi@@ tion of a magazine or a newspaper , which in itself is a multi-@@ size art medium . 
we also did something at the corner of this special issue of the guar@@ di@@ an . 
we have designed a very high resol@@ ution wrong display which is much higher than a normal display and we have add@@ ed extra content . 
if you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see them here . 
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations . 
and this really pic@@ ks up on these ideas to elimin@@ ate these restri@@ ctions on the available space on the screen . 
we hope that this does not mean any more po@@ p-@@ up@@ s and other non@@ sense - that should not be necessary . 
of course , ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this . 
and i really do not want to spend a lot of time here except to say that we will also contribu@@ te to this area . 
but these are all roads in the u .@@ s .@@ a . 
super@@ im@@ posed on top of the earth@@ y image of nasa . 
let &apos;s get something else out now . 
that is even live on the internet . they can ver@@ i@@ fy it . 
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th that really combin@@ es two different technologies . 
one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ go@@ n and the other is a very good research on computer vision conduc@@ ted by no@@ ah sna@@ vely , a university student from the university of washington , under the ad@@ vice of steve sei@@ tz at the u@@ w 
and ri@@ ck sz@@ eli@@ sk@@ i was done by microsoft research . a very good co@@ operation . 
so this is live on the internet . it is powered by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ go@@ n . 
you can see that when we create this kind of view where we can pen@@ et@@ rate through images and make this experience of multiple resol@@ ution . 
but the spa@@ tial ar@@ ran@@ gement of the pictures is indeed of importance here . 
the computer vision algorith@@ ms have cap@@ tured these images together to cor@@ respond to the real space in which they were taken , all of which were made near the gras@@ s@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies . here you can see elements of stabili@@ zed sli@@ des or pan@@ o@@ rami@@ c image process@@ ing and all these things have been spa@@ tially related . 
i &apos;m not sure if i still have time to show them other surro@@ und@@ ings . 
there are some that are much more spa@@ tial . 
i would like to show straight one of nor@@ ah &apos;s original recor@@ ds and that &apos;s from an early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th we first worked on this summer to show them what i believe is really the poin@@ te behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th technology is . and this is not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments we have on the website . 
we had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on . 
this is a re@@ construction of cat@@ he@@ dra@@ l not@@ re dam@@ e , which was done exc@@ lu@@ si@@ vely in the computer with images of fli@@ ck@@ r . just enter not@@ re dam@@ e in fli@@ ck@@ r and you will get pictures of men in t-@@ shir@@ ts and on the university cam@@ pus and so on . each of these orange con@@ es represents a picture that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model . 
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they are all spa@@ tially related in this way . 
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way . 
, you know , i never thought that i would eventually work at microsoft . 
i am very gra@@ te@@ ful for the re@@ ception here . 
, i guess you can see that these are many different types of cam@@ er@@ as@@ : everything is there , from the handy camera to professional sl@@ rs , a pretty large number of them , all of which have been pat@@ ched together in this environment . 
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones . 
many of them are covered by faces , etc . 
somewhere here are a number of photographs - here they are . 
this is actually a poster of not@@ re dam@@ e , which was recor@@ ded cor@@ rec@@ tly . 
we can switch from the poster to a physical view of this environment . 
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment . data is now being colle@@ cted from everyone - from the entire collective memory of what , visu@@ ally , the earth looks like - and everything is connected . 
all these photos are lin@@ ked together and something is created that is bigger than the sum of the parts . 
you get a model that comes from all over the world . 
consider this as the continu@@ ation of ste@@ phen law@@ ler &apos;s work on virtual earth . 
and that &apos;s something that grow@@ s with the complexity of how people use it , and its value to the user grow@@ s with the appli@@ cation . 
her own photos are tag@@ ged with meta@@ data typ@@ ed by another person . 
if someone made the effort and lab@@ ele@@ d all these sa@@ in@@ ts and tells them who they all are , then my photo of dam@@ e cat@@ he@@ dra@@ l is suddenly en@@ rich@@ ed with all these data and i can use it as a starting point to enter this room di@@ ve into these meta@@ -@@ ver@@ ses , which use photos of other people and th@@ us make a kind of cros@@ s-@@ mod@@ al social experience with the use of other provi@@ ders . 
and , of course , the by@@ -@@ product of all this are the imm@@ ens@@ ely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , ob@@ tain@@ ed not only from over@@ fli@@ ghts or satellite imag@@ ery and so on , but from collective memor@@ ies . 
many thanks . 
, do i understand you right ? your software allows , at a certain point in time , within the next few years , all the images shared by someone in the world to be lin@@ ked in princi@@ ple@@ ? 
yes . she does nothing but discover . 
if you want to create hyper@@ links between the images . 
and she does so because of the content in the pictures . 
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think of the ab@@ und@@ ance of se@@ man@@ tic information that many of these images have . 
like when you do a web search for pictures , where you enter sent@@ ences and the text of the website con@@ tains a lot of information about which picture that is . 
but what if the picture links you with all your pic@@ tur@@ es@@ ? 
then the scop@@ e of the se@@ man@@ tic link and the wealth that results from it is really enormous . it is a classi@@ c network effect . 
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . con@@ gra@@ tu@@ lations . 
thank you very much . 
i will tell you some things from my book which , i hope , will be in harmon@@ y with other things that you have already heard . and i will try to create a few connections myself , if they did not notice them . 
i want to start with what i call &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma &quot; call . 
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what@@ ? 
the offi@@ cial belie@@ fs of all western industri@@ alized societies . 
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma works this wa@@ y@@ : if our goal is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the well-@@ being of our citizens , this is above all achie@@ ved by ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the freedom of the individual . 
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , meaning@@ ful , an indi@@ spen@@ sa@@ ble pre@@ requi@@ site for the human . 
when people have freedom , then each of us acts for ourselves to do the things that ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our common good and no one has to decide for us . 
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice . 
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have . and the more freedom they have , the more common they will have . 
this is , i think , so deeply an@@ cho@@ red in our water supply that nobody would come to question it in the same way . 
and it is also deeply roo@@ ted in our lives . 
i will give you some examples of what allows us modern progress . 
this is my super@@ market . not a big one . 
i just want to say something about sal@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing . 
there are 17@@ 5 dre@@ ss@@ ings in my super@@ market if you do not count the 10 different extra oli@@ ve o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic vi@@ nega@@ r that you could buy to make a large number of your own sal@@ ad des@@ sing@@ s , in the un@@ likely event that none of the 17@@ 5 in the store will be for you cor@@ rect is . 
so that &apos;s how the super@@ market is . 
and then head to the consum@@ er electro@@ ni@@ cs shop to put together a stere@@ o system - speak@@ ers , c@@ d players , a cas@@ sett@@ e player , radio , am@@ pli@@ fi@@ ers . and in this one electro@@ ni@@ cs business there are so many stere@@ o systems . 
we can put together 6@@ .@@ 5 million different stere@@ o systems from the components off@@ ered in this one store . 
you have to ad@@ mit that this is a big choice . 
in other areas - the world of communication . 
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have every phone provi@@ der you wanted , as long as he came from ma bell . 
they ren@@ ted their phone . they did not buy it .
a consequ@@ ence of this was that the phone was never broken . 
these days are over . 
we now have almost an infin@@ ite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones . 
these are the mobile phones of the future . 
my favorite is the one in the middle - mp@@ 3 player , nose hair tri@@ mmer and cre@@ me bru@@ lee tor@@ ch . 
and if you have not seen this in your shop yet , you can be sure that you will soon . 
and what it does is make people run into the business and ask that question . 
do you know now what the answer to this question is@@ ? 
the answer is &quot; no &quot; 
it is not possible to buy a mobile phone that does not do too much . 
in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying objects , the same explosion of choices appli@@ es . 
healthcare - it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do . 
instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you@@ : we could do a or we could do b . 
a has these advan@@ tages and risks . 
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ? 
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do@@ ? &quot; 
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks . 
what do you want to do ? 
and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do@@ ? &quot; 
the doctor says , &quot; but i am not her . &quot; 
the result is - we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y &quot; , that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift is the bur@@ den of responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something - especially the doctor - to someone who knows nothing and is most likely ill and therefore not in the best const@@ it@@ ution is a decision to make - especially the patient . 
there is tremendous marketing for pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs for people like you and me who , when they think about it , do not make any sense because we do not buy them . 
why do you pro@@ mote us if we can not bu@@ y@@ ? 
the answer is@@ : you expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change of the pres@@ cri@@ ption . 
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , as this film is inten@@ ded to show . 
we do not in@@ her@@ it an identity , we inven@@ t it . 
and we rein@@ vent ourselves as often as we like . 
that is , every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be . 
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everyone had one and they got married as fast as they could and then had children as fast as they could . 
the only true choice was &quot; who &quot; , not when , and not what they did after@@ wards . 
everything is easy to have no@@ wa@@ days . 
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did earlier . 
and not because they are less intelligent and not because they are less care@@ ful . 
it is because they are bus@@ y with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; shall i mar@@ ry or not , shall i mar@@ ry no@@ w@@ ? 
should i mar@@ ry lat@@ er@@ ? should i first have children , or only make a care@@ er@@ ? &quot; 
they are all enga@@ ging questions . 
and they will answer these questions reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of whether that means doing all the tas@@ ks i as@@ sign them and not getting a good grade on my course . 
and indeed they should do that . these are important questions to answer . 
work - we are bl@@ essed , as cla@@ ri@@ fied by car@@ l , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day from every place on the planet - except for the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel . 
by the way , there is a corner of which i will not tell anyone where the wir@@ ele@@ ss@@ lan works . 
i will not tell them because i want to use it . 
so , what it means , this unbe@@ lie@@ vable freedom of choice we have to make decisions reg@@ ar@@ ding work , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work . 
we can watch our kids play soc@@ cer and we have our cell@@ phone on one hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on the other hi@@ p , and our laptop probably on our la@@ p . 
and even if they are all turned off , every minute we watch our child mu@@ ti@@ lat@@ ing a foot@@ ball match we ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call@@ ? 
should i re@@ pl@@ y to this e-@@ ma@@ il@@ ? should i write this let@@ ter@@ ? &quot; 
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it will certainly shape your experience of your child &apos;s soc@@ cer game very differently than it would have been . 
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle , life is a matter of choice . 
and the world we lived in looked like this . 
by that i mean , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice . 
and the world we live in looks like this . 
and the question is , is that good news or bad new@@ s@@ ? 
the answer is &quot; yes &quot; , 
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;ll be sick of it . 
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people . 
an effect , parado@@ xic@@ ally , is that it paraly@@ zes rather than liber@@ ates . 
with so many opti@@ ons to choose from , people find it very hard to decide at all . 
i will give you another dra@@ stic example of this , a study on invest@@ ing in volun@@ tar@@ y ol@@ d-@@ age provi@@ sion . 
a collea@@ gue of mine had access to investment fil@@ es of van@@ guar@@ d , the gigan@@ tic fund of about one million employees and about 2000 different jobs . 
and what she found was 10 per cent of the fund@@ s the employe@@ r off@@ ered , the participa@@ tion dec@@ reas@@ ed by 2 per cent . 
they offer 50 investment fund@@ s - 10 percent fewer employees than if they off@@ ered only 5 . why ? 
because there are 50 investment fund@@ s to choose from , it &apos;s so hard to decide which one to choose , that they post@@ pon@@ e it to tomorrow . 
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never comes . 
do you understand that this does not just mean that people have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they do not have enough money to travel , it also means that making decisions is so difficult that they miss out on large investment off@@ er@@ ings from their employe@@ rs . 
by fail@@ ing to atten@@ d , they spend up to $ 50@@ 00 per year on the employe@@ r , who would have been happy to increase their contribu@@ tion . 
paraly@@ sis is a consequ@@ ence of too many choices . 
and i think it makes the world look that way . 
you really want to make the right decision , if it is for all et@@ ern@@ ity , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
they do not want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing . 
so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the sele@@ ction than if we had had the opportunity to choose between fewer opti@@ ons . 
and there are several reasons for this . 
one of them is due to the wide variety of different sal@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ings when you buy one and it is not perfect - and which sal@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing is already perfe@@ ct@@ ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made another decision that would have been better . and what happened this pic@@ tor@@ ial alternative causes them to reg@@ re@@ t the decision , and this repe@@ nt nega@@ tively affec@@ ts the satis@@ fac@@ tion they had of their decision made , even if it was a good decision . 
the more possibilities there are , the easier it is not to reg@@ re@@ t anything that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting for the choice you make . 
secon@@ dly , what econom@@ ists call opp@@ er@@ tun@@ ity costs . 
dan gil@@ bert has made a big point this morning by telling how much the way in which we rate things depen@@ ds on what we compare . 
well , if there are many alterna@@ tives to consider , it is easy to think of attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of alterna@@ tives that exc@@ lu@@ de them , making them less satis@@ fied with the alterna@@ tives they have cho@@ sen . 
here is an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze . 
but here is what they should have thought . 
here are a few on the ham@@ p@@ tons . 
very expensive real est@@ ate . 
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for themselves . 
what could be better ? &quot; dam@@ ned &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it is aug@@ ust . 
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone . 
i could park right in front of my house . &quot; 
and he spen@@ ds 2 weeks of the thought that he has miss@@ ed the opportunity to have a great par@@ king day after day . 
opp@@ er@@ tun@@ ity costs lower the satis@@ fac@@ tion we recei@@ ve through our sele@@ ction , even if what we have cho@@ sen is fantastic . 
and the more possibilities there are to choose from , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of this sele@@ ction are taken into account in the opp@@ er@@ tun@@ ity costs . 
here is another example . 
well , this carto@@ on makes some stat@@ ements . 
he makes a stat@@ ement about it in the now to live and maybe also about things to do slowly . 
but one important point he makes is that whenever you decide to do something , you decide not to do other things . 
and these other things may have many attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures , and what they will do will be less appe@@ aling . 
third , es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations . 
this hit me when i wanted to exchange my je@@ ans . 
i wear je@@ ans , almost all the time . 
and there was a time when there were only je@@ ans of one type , and they bought them , and they did not fit well , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable and if they had wor@@ n them long enough and wash@@ ed them enough , they started &quot; ok &quot; to feel . 
so , to buy new je@@ ans after many years of wearing the old ones , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like some je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot; 
and the sel@@ ler said , &quot; do you want sli@@ m , ligh@@ t-@@ fit@@ ting or wid@@ e@@ ? 
do you want butt@@ ons or zi@@ p@@ pers@@ ? stone or aci@@ d wash@@ ed@@ ? 
do you want to pun@@ ct@@ ure je@@ ans@@ ? 
you want to cut them down wide , con@@ ical , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h . . . &quot; , and so on he said . 
my ja@@ w was down and after i re@@ covered i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the kind that used to be the only type . &quot; 
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all those dam@@ n je@@ ans and left the shop - and i say the truth - with the best mat@@ ching je@@ ans i &apos;ve ever had . 
i had it better . all of these choices allowed me to do better . 
but i felt worse . 
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself . 
the reason that i felt worse , with all these opti@@ ons available , my expec@@ tations of what a good pair of je@@ ans was , went up . 
i had very low expec@@ tations . i had no conc@@ re@@ te expec@@ tations , as they exist@@ ed only in one way . 
when they came in 100 species , dam@@ n , one of them should have been perfe@@ ct@@ , 
and what i got was good , but it was not perfect . 
so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i had was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting compared to what i expected . 
add@@ ing opportunities to people &apos;s lives will inevi@@ tab@@ ly increase expec@@ tations people will have about how good those opti@@ ons will be . 
and this leads to less satis@@ fac@@ tion with the results , even if the results are good . 
nobody in the world of marketing knows this . because if they did , they would all not know what this is about . 
the truth is more like this . 
the reason is that in the past everything was better when everything was worse , when everything was worse , it was possible for the people to make experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise . 
no@@ wa@@ days , in the world we live in - we are weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction as expec@@ tation - the best you can ever hope for is that things are as good as you expect them to be . 
they are never pleas@@ antly surprised . because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , are high . 
the secret to happiness - that &apos;s what they all came for - the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations . 
i would like to say - a short %autobiographical moment - that i am married to a woman and she is really very wonderful . 
i could not have done better . i did not sett@@ le down . 
but sett@@ ling down is not always such a bad thing . 
ultimately , a consequ@@ ence of buying a ba@@ d-@@ fit@@ ting je@@ ans when there is only one style to buy is that when they are dis@@ satis@@ fied , they ask themselves why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could they have don@@ e@@ ? 
when hundreds of different types of je@@ ans are available , and they buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and they ask why , who is responsi@@ ble@@ ? 
it is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is@@ : you . 
they could have done better . 
with 100 different types of je@@ ans in the shop window , there is no exc@@ use for mista@@ kes . 
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted , they bla@@ me themselves . 
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation . 
i believe a significant - not the only one , but a significant contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and even su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have experienced dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment because their standards are so high . and then , if you have to explain yourself these experiences , you think it &apos;s your fau@@ lt . 
and so the balance she@@ et result is that we are generally better , obje@@ c@@ tively , and feel worse . 
so let me remin@@ d you . 
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , that one that we all consider right is completely wrong . it is not true . 
there is no question that some choice is better than none , but it does not follow that more choice is better than some choice . 
there is a mag@@ ical amount . i do not know what it is . 
i &apos;m pretty sure that we miss@@ ed this point for a long time in the sele@@ ction of our well-@@ being impro@@ ved . 
now , as a matter of principle - i &apos;m almost done - as a matter of principle , the thing to think about is . what makes all this choice possible in the industri@@ alized societies is the material wealth . 
there are many places in the world , and we have heard of many of them whose problem is not the big choice . 
your problem is that you have too little . 
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a weird problem of modern , rich , western societies . 
and what is so fru@@ strat@@ ing and anno@@ ying is@@ : steve le@@ vi@@ tt told them yesterday how these expensive and hard to instal@@ l child se@@ ats do not help . it is a waste of money . 
what i tell them is that these expensive , complicated decisions - it &apos;s not easy they do not help . 
they even hurt . 
they make sure that we stand there worse . 
if something of what would allow people of our society to make decisions on societies where people have not cho@@ sen enough , would not only improve people &apos;s lives , but ours would also be impro@@ ved . 
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ et@@ o impro@@ vement appli@@ cation . 
reven@@ ue re@@ distribution will make everyone &apos;s better - not just the poor - because all of this big choice is pla@@ gu@@ ing us . 
in conclu@@ sion , please read this carto@@ on , and , a highly developed person , says , &quot; ah , what does this fish know@@ ? 
you know nothing in this fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l . &quot; 
imp@@ over@@ ished imagination , a shor@@ ts@@ ig@@ ht@@ ed view of the world - and that &apos;s the way i read it first . 
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to believe that the fish knows something . 
for the truth is that if you break the fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paraly@@ sis . 
if you break the fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , lower the satis@@ fac@@ tion . 
they increase paraly@@ sis and reduce satis@@ fac@@ tion . 
everyone needs a fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l . 
this is almost certainly too limited - possibly also for the fish , definitely for us . 
but the loss of a metaph@@ ori@@ cal fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ er@@ able , and , i suppose , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and about disco@@ vering new groups of genes . 
in fact , we are starting from a new poin@@ t@@ : we have digit@@ i@@ zed biology and now we are trying to move from digital code to a new phase of biology by designing and building new life . 
we have always tried to ask significant questions . 
what is life@@ ? it is something that i believe many biolog@@ ists have tried to understand at different levels . 
we have tried different approach@@ es to simpli@@ fy it to the minim@@ um components . 
we digit@@ i@@ zed nearly 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , the shift from the analog@@ ue world of biology to the digital world of computers took place . 
now we are trying to ask if we can re@@ generate life or if we can create new life from this digital univer@@ se@@ ? 
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gei@@ tali@@ um , that has the small@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate itself in the lab . and we tried to do it with an even smaller genome . 
we managed to do without about one hundred genes out of the 500 or so that are here . 
but if we look at this meta@@ bol@@ ic map , which is very simple compared to ours . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all those genes that we can elimin@@ ate one by one , it is very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell . 
therefore , we decided that the only way forward is to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some , which allows us to var@@ y the individual components and th@@ us ask some of these fundamental questions . 
and so we started with the question , can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some@@ ? 
does chemistry allow you to create these really big molecules that have never been done be@@ fore@@ ? 
and , if we can , can we start the chromo@@ some@@ ? 
by the way , a chromo@@ some is just one piece of ine@@ rt chemical material . 
our steps in digit@@ i@@ zing life have been exponenti@@ al . 
our ability to write genetic code has developed very slowly , but it has increas@@ ed non@@ eth@@ eless . and our last point would now be an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve . 
we started 15 years ago . 
it actually took several years starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we made the first experiments . 
as it turned out , dna syn@@ thesis is very difficult . 
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 characters long , but it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mista@@ kes happen . 
so we had to develop a new method with which we could assem@@ ble these small pieces and cor@@ rect the mista@@ kes . 
that was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information , the ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 genome . 
it is a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria . 
we made small pieces , made a mistake cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters . 
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of ine@@ rt chemical and put it in a bacteri@@ um , and the bacteri@@ um began reading the genetic code and made vir@@ al particles . 
the vir@@ al particles were then rele@@ ased from the cells and came back , killing e . col@@ i . 
recently i spoke to the oil industry and they said that they understood this model exactly . 
they laugh@@ ed more than you do here . 
so we think that this is a situation where software can actually build your own hard@@ ware in a biological system . 
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some . it has more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought , we build it in cas@@ sett@@ es of the size of the virus with which we could var@@ y the size of the cas@@ sett@@ es to understand what the individual components of a living cell are . 
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information must be really er@@ ro@@ r@@ -@@ free . 
when we first sequen@@ ced the genome in 199@@ 5 , the er@@ ror rate was one er@@ ror per 10,000 base pa@@ irs . 
we found 30 er@@ ro@@ rs when re@@ sequen@@ cing . if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible to boot . 
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 characters long and over@@ la@@ p with other 50@@ -@@ letter pieces to make smaller sub-@@ uni@@ ts fit together . 
we have in@@ corpo@@ rat@@ ed unique elements here . 
you may have heard that we have water mark@@ s instal@@ led . 
think about it@@ : we have a 4@@ -@@ letter co@@ de@@ : a , c , g and t . 
tri@@ ple@@ ts of these letters - these letters en@@ code about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ d@@ s@@ ; and here is a single determin@@ ation for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds . 
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sent@@ ences , thoughts . 
at first we only sign@@ ed . 
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it was not poetry . 
we designed the pieces so that we could simply dis@@ assem@@ ble them with enzy@@ mes . there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair and re@@ assem@@ ble them . 
and we started making pieces starting with pieces con@@ tain@@ ing five to seven thousand letters , add@@ ing them to each other to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to re-@@ assem@@ ble , up to 7@@ 2,000 . 
in each step , we produced these pieces in exc@@ ess so we could sequence them because we were trying to create a very rob@@ ust process that you will see in a minute . 
we tried to get to the point of auto@@ mati@@ on . 
so , that looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball play@@ off . 
if we get to these really big pieces - with over 100,000 base pa@@ irs - then these will not be easy in e . col@@ i grow . it exc@@ ee@@ ds all possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms . 
we knew about a mechanis@@ m called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put together such pieces . 
here is an example of it . there is an organis@@ m called the de@@ in@@ oc@@ occu@@ s radi@@ od@@ ur@@ ans that can survive three million rad@@ s of radiation . 
in the upp@@ er field you can see that its chromo@@ some is simply fall@@ ing apart . 
12 to 24 hours later , everything has re@@ assem@@ bled as it was . 
we have thousands of organisms that can do that . 
these organisms can be totally dri@@ ed out , they can even live in vac@@ u@@ um . 
i am absolutely sure that living in space can exist and move in search of a@@ qua@@ tic conditions . 
indeed , nasa has shown that there is much of it out there . 
here is a picture of the molecule we made by using these processes - in fact we only used ye@@ ast mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we fit them . he@@ fe then auto@@ matically mer@@ ges these . 
this is not an electro@@ n micro@@ graph , it is a regular microscop@@ e image . 
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscop@@ e . 
these are recor@@ dings over a dur@@ ation of 6 seconds . 
this is the publi@@ cation that we recently comple@@ ted . 
that &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code . it is the largest molecule of defined structure ever created by humans . 
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million . 
if we were to print it out with a fo@@ nt size of 10 and without spac@@ ing , it would cover 14@@ 2 pages just to print that genetic code . 
now , how do we start a chromo@@ some@@ ? how do we activ@@ ate it@@ ? 
it is obvious that it is very simple with a virus . it is much more complicated to deal with bacteria . 
it &apos;s just as easy to do it in eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes as we are@@ : you just take out the nu@@ cle@@ us and put in another , and that &apos;s exactly what they all heard about clo@@ ning . 
in arch@@ a@@ e@@ bacteria , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell but only recently have we shown that one can perfor@@ m a complete transplan@@ tation of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it . 
we pur@@ i@@ fied the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ bi@@ al species . roughly speaking , these two are as far apart as humans and mi@@ ce . we add@@ ed some extra genes so we could sele@@ ct this chromo@@ some . we dec@@ om@@ pose it with enzy@@ mes to destro@@ y all proteins . and it was amazing when we put it in a cell - and you will appreci@@ ate our very mat@@ ure graphi@@ cs here - 
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell . 
in fact , we thought this was the end , but we tried to take the process a little further . 
that &apos;s the main mechanis@@ m of evolution here . 
we find all sorts of species here that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third from somewhere , add@@ ing thousands of characteri@@ stics in just one second each to a species . 
humans who imagine evolution as one gene being changed at a time have miss@@ ed much of biology . 
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually dig@@ est dna . 
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell has non@@ e@@ ; the chromo@@ some@@ s we have already inse@@ r@@ ted . 
it was expres@@ sed in the cell and recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as a foreign material dig@@ est@@ ed it and so we ended up with only one cell with a new chromo@@ some . 
it turned blue because of the gene we had inse@@ r@@ ted . 
and after a very short time , it had lost all of the characteri@@ stics of the species and completely conver@@ ted to a new species based on the new software we put into the cell . 
all proteins changed mem@@ bran@@ es - when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we trans@@ fer@@ red . 
it may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y , but we can change things quite dra@@ matically by moving the software dna . 
now i have argu@@ ed that this is not the gene@@ sis - this is based on 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution 
and i have argu@@ ed that we may be creating a new form of the cam@@ brian explosion in which there could be massive new species forma@@ tion based on this digital design . 
why should we do th@@ at@@ ? 
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need . 
we are about to grow from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years . 
to put it in my con@@ text@@ : i was born in 194@@ 6 . 
today there are three people on this planet for anyone who exist@@ ed in 194@@ 6@@ ; it will be four within 40 years . 
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people . 
it will be a challenge to offer this for 9 . 
we need over five billion tons of coal , plus 30 billion bar@@ rel@@ s of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day . 
when we think about biological processes or any process to replace them , it becomes a huge challenge . 
then , of course , there is all the co2 of this material that ends up in the atmosphere . 
now , from our disco@@ ver@@ ies from around the world , we have a dat@@ ab@@ ase of about 20 million , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future . 
the electro@@ ni@@ cs industry had do@@ zens of components and look at the variety that resul@@ ted . 
here we come first and fore@@ most to the limit@@ s of biological reality and to those of our imagination . 
today we have technologies based on these fast syn@@ thesis metho@@ ds to do what we call combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gene@@ tics . 
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can produce millions of chromo@@ some@@ s a day . 
if you imagine creating these 20 million different genes or optimi@@ zing these processes to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or drug new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can do more with a small team of molecular biolog@@ ists than the last 20 years of science . 
and it &apos;s just a ni@@ che sele@@ ction . we can sele@@ ct for vi@@ ability , production of chemicals or fuel production vac@@ cin@@ e production and so on . 
this is a recor@@ ding of real design software we are working on , with which you can actually sit down and identify new species at the computer design 
you know , we do not necessarily know what it will look like . we know exactly what their genetic code will look like . 
we are now foc@@ using on %fourth-generation fu@@ els . 
you &apos;ve recently seen cor@@ n on eth@@ an@@ ol which is just a bad experiment . 
we have second and third generation fu@@ els coming out relatively soon which will have much higher sugar levels , like oc@@ tan@@ e or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol . 
but , as we think , the only way that biology will have a big impact without further increasing the cost of food or restri@@ cting its avail@@ ability is when we see co2 as the source material , and so we are working on cells that are going aw@@ a@@ y@@ , 
and we think that we will be the first to use %fourth-generation fu@@ els in about 18 months . 
sun@@ light and co2 are a method - 
- but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different metho@@ ds . 
this is an organis@@ m we described in 199@@ 6 . 
he lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , with almost bo@@ iling water temper@@ atures . 
it conver@@ ts co2 into meth@@ an@@ e using hydrogen as a source of energy . 
we investi@@ gate whether we can use stor@@ ed co2 , which could easily be brought to production sites , conver@@ t the co2 into fuel to fuel this process . 
within a short spa@@ n of time , we believe we may be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life . 
you know , we really have - moder@@ ate goals like the re@@ plac@@ ement of the entire pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry . i agree . if you could not do that at ted , where el@@ se@@ ? to become a main source of energy . 
however , at the moment we are working on using the same approach@@ es for the development of vac@@ cin@@ es . 
they &apos;ve seen it this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year behind and have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vac@@ cin@@ e . 
i think that can be changed by creating re@@ combin@@ ant vac@@ cin@@ es in advan@@ ce . 
that &apos;s how the future could possibly look like with changes , today the evolutionary tree can be spe@@ d up with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ e@@ a , and possibly eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes . 
we are light years away from impro@@ ving people . our goal is simply that we have a chance to survive long enough to possibly do that . thank you so much ! 
at the last ted conference i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c . 
and i promis@@ ed to come back to explain how the machine works . 
so now it is time . and for all those who were not there at the time , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment ever under@@ taken - 27 kilometers in diam@@ et@@ er . 
his job is to create the conditions that exist@@ ed less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the beginning of the universe - up to 600 million times in a second . 
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ ta@@ king@@ ly ambi@@ ti@@ ous . 
this is the machine below gene@@ va . 
we take pictures of these mini@@ -@@ big bang@@ s in dete@@ ctors . 
i work on this . he calls himself at@@ las dete@@ ctor - 4@@ 4 meters in wid@@ th , 22 meters in diam@@ et@@ er . 
here a spec@@ tac@@ ular image of the at@@ las in the construction so you see the propor@@ tions . 
on the 10@@ th of september last year the machine started for the first time . 
and this picture was taken by at@@ las . 
it caused imm@@ ens@@ e che@@ ers in the control room . 
it is a picture of the first partic@@ le of radiation that covered the entire distance around the l@@ h@@ c , then deli@@ ber@@ ately colli@@ ded with a part of the l@@ h@@ c to make a rain of particles pat@@ ter on the dete@@ ctor . 
in other words , when we saw this picture on the 10@@ th of september , we knew the machine was working , which is a big tri@@ um@@ ph . 
i do not know if this caused the biggest che@@ ers , or this when someone visi@@ ted the google page and found the home@@ page like this . 
it means we achie@@ ved a cultural influence alo@@ n@@ g@@ side the scientific . 
about a week later there was a problem with the machine which had to do with these wir@@ es here - these gold@@ en wir@@ es here 
these wir@@ es conduc@@ t 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ per@@ e when the machine is running at high power . 
well , the engineers among you will look at them and say , &quot; no , they will not do that , these are little wir@@ es . &quot; 
they can do that because if you cool them very far , they become super@@ conduc@@ tors . 
at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , these wir@@ es can with@@ stand the ten@@ sion . 
in one of the connections , between over nine thousand magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a manufac@@ tory de@@ fe@@ ct . 
as a result wir@@ es are slightly hea@@ ted and 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ ps suddenly en@@ counter@@ ed electrical resi@@ stance . 
this was the result . 
well , all of this is even more impres@@ sive if you imagine that the magne@@ ts wei@@ gh over 20 tons and move by about 30 c@@ m . 
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts 
and had to re@@ move them , which we did . 
we condi@@ tioned them , re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ed them . 
they are all on their way back now . 
by the end of mar@@ ch the l@@ h@@ c will be oper@@ a@@ tional again . 
we will turn it on , and expect to gat@@ her first data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are . 
well , of course , in a way such acci@@ dents re@@ kind@@ led the debate about the value of science and engineering at such bor@@ ders . it is easy to re@@ je@@ ct such a thing . 
i think the fact that it is so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our bor@@ ders , is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c . 
i will leave my final words to an english scientist . hum@@ phr@@ ey da@@ vy , who i su@@ spec@@ t defen@@ ded the use@@ less experiments of his app@@ ren@@ tice , his app@@ ren@@ tice was michael far@@ ada@@ y , sa@@ i@@ d@@ : &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the development of the human mind as to assu@@ me that our scientific ideas are final , that there are no myster@@ ies in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complete , and that there are no new world@@ s to con@@ que@@ r . &quot; 
many thanks . 
i am a writer . 
writing books is my job , but of course it &apos;s more than that . 
it is also my big , life@@ long love and fascin@@ ation . 
and i do not expect that will ever change . 
however , there has recently been something weird in my life and career that has led me to completely re@@ think my relationship to this work . 
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book - a bio@@ graph@@ y called &quot; eat , pra@@ y , lo@@ ve@@ &quot; - ​​which , unlike any of my previous books , went out to the world for some reason and a great me@@ ga@@ -@@ event , international best@@ sel@@ ler -@@ ding was . 
the result is that no matter where i go , i &apos;m treated as if i was do@@ ome@@ d . 
seriously - do@@ ome@@ d@@ ! 
for example , they approach me with great conc@@ ern and say , &quot; are not you afraid that you will never exc@@ ee@@ d this success@@ ? 
are you not afraid that you will continue writing your whole life and never again create a book that interest@@ s anyone in the world@@ ? never again ? &quot; 
okay , that really makes you bra@@ ve . 
however , it would be worse if i did not remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told teena@@ gers that i wanted to be a writer , i was con@@ fron@@ ted with the same kind of fe@@ ar@@ ful reaction . 
people said , &quot; are not you sc@@ ared never to succe@@ ed@@ ? 
are not you afraid that the hum@@ ili@@ ation of a can@@ cell@@ ation kill@@ s you@@ ? 
are not you sc@@ ared that you &apos;re going to do this job all your life and that nothing will ever happen to it and that you &apos;ll die on a pil@@ e of broken dreams - your mouth filled with the bit@@ ter ash@@ es of fail@@ ur@@ e@@ ? &quot; 
that &apos;s about it , you know . 
the answer - the short answer to all these questions is@@ : &quot; yes . &quot; 
yes , i am afraid of all these things . 
and i always had . 
and i &apos;m afraid of many more things that nobody would guess . 
like alg@@ a@@ e - and other sc@@ ary things . 
but when it comes to writing i think about it recently and ask my@@ sel@@ f@@ : wh@@ y@@ ? 
is that sensi@@ ble@@ ? 
is it logi@@ cal that someone should be expected to be afraid to do the job he feels called to do@@ ? 
and what exactly is wrong with the creative activi@@ ties that make us un@@ certain about the mu@@ tual state of mind - in a way that other profession@@ s do not@@ ? 
my father , for example , was a chemi@@ st and i can not remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemi@@ st , when he was asked if he was afraid to be a chemi@@ st . 
with your chemi@@ st block@@ ade , john - how are you@@ ? s you with it@@ ? 
it just did not happen , you know@@ ? 
but to be fair - the group of chemi@@ sts has not received the repu@@ tation of al@@ co@@ hol@@ ic %manic-depressive people over the cent@@ ur@@ ies . 
but we wri@@ ters seem to have that kind of repu@@ tation . but not only the wri@@ ters , but the crea@@ tors of all gen@@ re@@ s , seem to have this repu@@ tation of being ment@@ ally uns@@ table ment@@ ally . 
all you have to do is look at the bit@@ ter death toll of truly great people from the tw@@ enti@@ eth century alone who died young and often by their own hands . 
and even those who did not actually comm@@ it su@@ i@@ cide seemed genu@@ ine@@ ly ne@@ gl@@ ec@@ ted by their tal@@ ents . 
norm@@ an ma@@ il@@ er said shor@@ tly before his death in his last interview , &quot; each of my books has killed me a bit further . &quot; 
an extraordinary stat@@ ement that you can make about your life &apos;s work . 
but we do not even fli@@ n@@ ch when we hear someone say something like that , because we know this kind of stat@@ ement for so long . somehow we have intern@@ alized and accep@@ ted the concept in such a way that creativity and sor@@ row somehow naturally bel@@ ong together and that art - in the end - always leads to the sou@@ l &apos;s dist@@ ress . 
the question that i would like to ask everyone here today is@@ : is this idea completely al@@ right for you@@ ? 
do you feel comfortable with it@@ ? because with only one centi@@ meter apart . . . i feel with this notion at all well . 
i think it &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting . 
and i find them dangerous . and i do not want to see it taken over in the next century . 
i find it better when we encourage our great creative to live . 
and i definitely know that for me - in my situation - it would be very dangerous to begin to so@@ ak down this dark path of gu@@ ess@@ ing - especially in the circum@@ stance that i am in my career right now . 
that is - loo@@ k@@ : i &apos;m pretty young . i am only about 40 years old . 
i may have another 40 years of work in my life . 
and it is very likely that everything i write from now on will be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the crazy success of my last book , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
i &apos;ll say it straight out , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here - it &apos;s very likely that my biggest success is behind me . 
oh , jesus , what a thou@@ ght@@ ! 
these are the kind of thoughts that can make someone start gi@@ n drin@@ king at 9 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning . and i do not want that . 
i would rather continue to do this work that i love . 
so the question is@@ : ho@@ w@@ ? 
after some time of refle@@ ction , it seems to me that in order to continue writing , i have to design some kind of prote@@ ctive psych@@ ological constru@@ ct . 
somehow , from now on , i have to find a way to keep writing safe distance between myself and my very natural opp@@ res@@ sion about how the reaction will be to the written . 
while i was looking for models to do that over the past year , i also sear@@ ched the past and tried to find other companies to see if they had any better or more reas@@ on@@ able ideas than we did to help creative people deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity . 
this search took me to ancient gre@@ ec@@ e and ancient ro@@ me . 
please follow me , because the circle will close again . 
but in ancient gre@@ ec@@ e and ro@@ me , people did not believe that creativity comes from people , ok@@ a@@ y@@ ? 
they believed that creativity was a divi@@ ne ser@@ van@@ t spirit coming to people from a dist@@ ant , un@@ known source - for reasons un@@ known , un@@ known . 
the gre@@ ek@@ s called these divi@@ ne ser@@ van@@ ts spir@@ its &quot; demon@@ &quot; of creativity . 
soc@@ rates is known to believe that he had a demo@@ n who told him wisdom from af@@ ar . 
the roman@@ s had the same idea , calling this kind of dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died creative mind a &quot; geni@@ us@@ &quot; . 
that &apos;s great . the roman@@ s did not really think that a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual . 
they believed that geni@@ us was that kind of mag@@ ical divi@@ ne being that was believed to live literally in the walls of an art studio - much like do@@ bby , the house el@@ f - who came out and assi@@ sted the artist in an invisible way and the result work . 
that &apos;s brilliant - there it is , the distance i spoke of - the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that prote@@ cts you from the consequences of your work . 
and everyone knew it worked that way , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
the artist of anti@@ qui@@ ty was prote@@ cted from certain things , such as , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
if your work was brilliant , you could not view everything for yourself . everyone knew that you had that bo@@ dile@@ ss geni@@ us that helped you . 
if your work flo@@ pped - not entirely your mistake , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
everyone knew your geni@@ us was a bit lam@@ e . 
so the people in the west have really thought about creativity for a long time . 
and then came the ren@@ ai@@ ss@@ ance and everything changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea was@@ : let us place the human individual in the center of the universe - over all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies . and there is no room left for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures to accept orders from the divi@@ ne . 
it is the beginning of rational human@@ ism and people began to believe that creativity came completely from their own individual . 
for the first time in history , people hear people call this geni@@ us a geni@@ us - instead of having a geni@@ us . 
i have to tell them@@ : i think that was a big mistake . 
you know ? i think allo@@ wing a mer@@ e person to think that he or she is like the ves@@ sel , like the pool and the essen@@ ce and the source of all divi@@ ne , creative , un@@ known , infin@@ ite myster@@ ies is a little bit too much responsibility to make them one to im@@ pose frag@@ il@@ e , human psych@@ e . 
it &apos;s like asking someone to swa@@ l@@ low the sun . 
that dis@@ fig@@ ures and dist@@ or@@ ts whole eg@@ os and it gener@@ ates all these un@@ atta@@ in@@ able expec@@ tations of success . 
i think that this pressure of success has destro@@ yed our artists of the past 500 years . 
and , if that &apos;s true - and i think it &apos;s true - the question is@@ : 
can we change it@@ ? 
perhaps to return to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the myster@@ y of the creative . 
maybe not . 
maybe we can not just er@@ ase the min@@ d@@ set of 500 years of rational human@@ ism in an 18@@ -@@ minute lec@@ ture . 
and there are certainly people in this audience who would really have legi@@ ti@@ mate scientific dou@@ b@@ ts about the notion of - basically - fair@@ ies that follow people and apply fair@@ y magic to their projects , etc . 
i probably will not be able to take all of them on this trip . 
but the question i want to raise is@@ : why not@@ ? 
why not think about it@@ ? 
because it makes as much sense as anything else that i &apos;ve heard of when it comes to expla@@ ining the absolutely ma@@ dd@@ ening ca@@ price of the creative process . 
a process that - as anyone who has ever tried to do something - in other wor@@ d@@ s@@ : everyone here - not always beha@@ ving reas@@ on@@ ably . 
in fact , sometimes he can feel down@@ right para@@ normal . 
i met recently when i met the extraordinary american poe@@ t ru@@ th stone , now over 90 years old , but a poe@@ t all her life . she told me that when she was growing up in village virg@@ ini@@ a she was working out in the fields . she said she could feel and hear a poe@@ m about the landscape approach@@ ing her . 
she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ing train of air@@ , 
that would come to them over the land . 
she felt when it came , because it would make the earth sha@@ ke under her feet . 
she knew she could only do one thing at such a moment . and that was - in her words - &quot; run like a de@@ vil@@ &quot; . 
she ran like a de@@ vil to the house while being pers@@ ecu@@ ted by this poe@@ m . all that mat@@ ter@@ ed was that she had to get to a she@@ et of paper and a pen quickly enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through it , she could catch it and hold onto the she@@ et . 
other times she was not fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she did not reach the house and the poe@@ m roll@@ ed through her and she miss@@ ed it . she said it would continue to cross land and , as she said , &quot; look for another poe@@ t@@ &quot; . 
and then there were those moments - the part i &apos;ll never forget - she said there were moments when she almost miss@@ ed it . 
so@@ : she run@@ s to the house and sear@@ ches for the paper and the poe@@ m goes through her and she grab@@ s a pen just as it pas@@ ses through her and then - she said - it was like grab@@ bing it with her other hand and grab@@ bing it to get . 
she caught the poe@@ m on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took it on the she@@ et of paper . 
on these occasi@@ ons , the poe@@ m arrived imp@@ ec@@ cab@@ ly and in@@ tac@@ t on the paper - but back@@ wards - from the last word to the first . 
when i heard that , i thought , &quot; that &apos;s sc@@ ary - that &apos;s exactly how my creative process works . &quot; 
that &apos;s not like my creative process at all - i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel@@ ! 
i am a mul@@ e . in order to work i have to get up and swe@@ at every day at the same time , strug@@ gling and really un@@ comfortable . 
but even i in my mul@@ e type have sometimes tou@@ ched this thing . 
and i guess many of you did that too . 
even i had work or ideas that came through from a source that i really can not identify with . 
what is this thin@@ g@@ ? 
and how do we rela@@ te to it without losing our mind , but , on the contra@@ ry , even keeping our mental health@@ ? 
for me , the best living example of how to do this is the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ its . i was allowed to interview him for a magazine a few years ago . 
we talked about this top@@ ic . and you know what@@ ? for most of his life , tom was the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ mented modern artist who tried to control and hand@@ le these un@@ controll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that lived in him . 
but then he got older and cal@@ mer . he told me that one day he dro@@ ve on an expres@@ swa@@ y in los angeles . and everything changed for him . 
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly heard a small frag@@ ment of a mel@@ od@@ y that , as is often the case with inspi@@ ration@@ s , is pain@@ fully difficult to gras@@ p . and he wants her . she is gor@@ ge@@ ous . he lu@@ sts for it , but he can not believe it . 
he does not have paper , he does not have a pen , he does not have a ta@@ pe recor@@ der . 
so he begins to as@@ cen@@ d this old opp@@ res@@ sion in him , such as &quot; i will lose this thing and will be pers@@ ecu@@ ted forever by this song . 
i &apos;m not good enough , i can not do it . &quot; 
but instead of pan@@ ic@@ king , he simply stopped . 
he finished the whole thought process and did something completely new . 
he simply looked up into the sky and said , &quot; exc@@ use me , can not you see that i drive a car@@ ? &quot; 
&quot; do i look like i could just write a son@@ g@@ ? 
if you really want to exist , come back to a better moment , if i can take care of you . 
if not , somebody is tor@@ ment@@ ing someone else today . 
go and tor@@ ture leon@@ ard co@@ hen . &quot; 
his whole working process changed after that . 
not the work itself . it was still often as dark as ever . 
but the process and the heavy opp@@ res@@ sion that surro@@ unds him was li@@ ft@@ ed when he took the geni@@ us out of himself , where he caused nothing but anno@@ y@@ ance and left him where he came from , so to speak . he realized that it did not have to be an intern@@ alized , tor@@ ment@@ ing thing . 
there could be a pe@@ cul@@ i@@ ar , won@@ dro@@ us , bizar@@ re collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the alien , ex@@ ternal thing that was not quite tom . 
when i heard this story , it also changed a bit the way i worked and it saved me once before . 
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of &quot; eat , pra@@ y , lo@@ ve@@ &quot; . i fell into one of those pit@@ s of dou@@ bt that we all fall into when we work on something and it does not work out . you start to think it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this will be the worst book ever written . 
not only bad , but the worst of times . 
i started to think i should just stam@@ p the project . 
but then i reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed how tom had spo@@ ken in the open air and i tried it . 
so i raised my eyes from the manu@@ scri@@ pt and spoke my comm@@ ent in the direction of an empty corner of the room . 
i said al@@ oud , &quot; listen , you thing , you and i both know , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not my fau@@ lt , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
because you see , i invest everything i have . i do not have more than that . 
so if you want it better , you have to show up here and keep your share of the agre@@ ement . 
okay . but , if you do not . . . you know something , then hell with it . 
i will continue writing anyway , because that &apos;s my job . 
and i would like to please record that i was here today for my part of the job . &quot; 
because . . . . . . in the end it is like this . cent@@ ur@@ ies ago , in the deser@@ ts of north africa , people gather@@ ed for mo@@ on@@ light festi@@ val@@ s with sac@@ red dan@@ ces and music , which were held for hours - until da@@ wn . 
these festi@@ val@@ s have always been great because the dan@@ cers were professional and they were fantastic . 
but every now and then , very ra@@ rely , something special happened . one of the ac@@ tors actually became trans@@ cen@@ dent@@ al . 
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that you have all seen such a thing in your life before . 
it was as if time were at a stand@@ still and the dan@@ cer was ste@@ pping through a kind of gate . he did nothing unlike he has ever done before - 1,000 ni@@ ghts before . but everything came together . 
and all of a sudden , he no longer appe@@ ared pur@@ ely human . 
it was li@@ t from the inside and li@@ t from below and everything li@@ t up with a divi@@ ne fire . 
when something happened back then , people knew what that was . they called it by his name . 
they put their hands together and began to sing@@ : &quot; all@@ ah , all@@ ah , all@@ ah , god , god . &quot; 
that &apos;s god , you know@@ ? 
interesting histor@@ ical foot@@ not@@ e@@ : when the mo@@ ons con@@ que@@ red southern spa@@ in , they brought with them this need . over the cent@@ ur@@ ies , the pro@@ nu@@ n@@ ci@@ ation changed from &quot; all@@ ah , all@@ ah , all@@ ah@@ &quot; to &quot; ol@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é@@ &quot; , which is still heard in bul@@ l@@ figh@@ ts and fla@@ men@@ co dan@@ ces . 
if a perfor@@ mer in spa@@ in did something impossible , something mag@@ ic@@ al@@ : &quot; all@@ ah , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , all@@ ah , great , bra@@ vo@@ &quot; unbe@@ lie@@ vable , there it is@@ : a gli@@ mp@@ se of god . 
and that &apos;s great because we need that . 
but , the tri@@ cky part follo@@ ws the next morning , when the dan@@ cer himself wa@@ kes up and reali@@ zes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;@@ clock on a tu@@ es@@ day - and he no longer car@@ ries a bit of god in him . 
he is just an aging mor@@ tal with ach@@ ing kn@@ ee@@ s . and maybe he will never rise again to those hei@@ ghts . 
and maybe someone will never call god &apos;s name again when he turns . but what should he do with the rest of his life@@ ? 
that is hard . 
this is one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ rec@@ tions to a creative life . 
but maybe it does not have to be so full of pain if from the beginning you did not believe that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your existence came from them . 
if you may just believe that they are a lo@@ an - of an uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able source for a sele@@ ct time of their lives , which will be passed on to someone else when they are done with it . 
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything . 
that &apos;s how i started to think , and i think so for the past few months while working on the book that will be rele@@ ased soon - as the dangerous , fri@@ ght@@ ening , highly anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed follo@@ wer of my fre@@ ak@@ ish success . 
what i have to constantly tell myself , if i go crazy about it , is@@ : do not be afraid . 
do not be dis@@ coura@@ ged . 
just do your job . 
be there for your contribu@@ tion , whatever it may be . 
if your job is dan@@ cing , dance . 
when the stupid divi@@ ne geni@@ us that is on your side deci@@ des to show a touch of wonder through your effort for a brief moment , then &quot; ol@@ é@@ ! &quot; 
and if not , still dance your dance . 
and &quot; ol@@ é@@ ! &quot; for you , despite all this . 
i believe in it and i feel we should teach it . 
&quot; ol@@ é@@ ! &quot; for you in spit@@ e of all this , just for the fact that you love the mer@@ e human and the stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to be there for it . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
ol@@ é@@ ! 
last year , i showed these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which was the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states for nearly three million years , has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent . 
but this does not stron@@ gl@@ y enough express the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem , as it does not show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of the ice . 
in a sense , the arc@@ tic ice ca@@ p is the be@@ ating heart of our global climate system . 
it grow@@ s in winter and sh@@ rin@@ ks in the summer . 
the next slide i show you is a ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se shot that has happened in the last 25 years . 
the perman@@ ent ice is marke@@ d in red . 
as you can see , it grow@@ s on the dark blue marke@@ d . this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in win@@ ter@@ ; and it sh@@ rin@@ ks in the summer . 
the so-@@ called dau@@ er@@ er@@ ei@@ s , five years old or older , is almost like blood that flo@@ ws out of the body here . 
in 25 years it will be gone from here to here . 
this is a problem as warming th@@ aw@@ s the fro@@ zen ground around the arc@@ tic ocean , where there are large amo@@ unts of fro@@ zen carbon which , when it th@@ aw@@ s , is conver@@ ted from micro@@ bi@@ al to meth@@ an@@ e . 
compared to the total amount of %climate-changing substan@@ ces in the atmosphere , this amount could double if we exc@@ ee@@ d this critical point . 
already in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka , meth@@ an@@ e is bub@@ bling out of the water on its own . 
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter of the university of al@@ as@@ ka has travel@@ ed with another working group to another sh@@ allow la@@ ke last winter . 
wo@@ w@@ ! 
she is fine . the question is , how will we far@@ e@@ ? 
and one reason is , this enormous ther@@ mal stor@@ age war@@ ms green@@ land from the north . 
this is an an@@ nu@@ al con@@ den@@ sation water flow . 
but the volu@@ mes are much bigger than ever . 
this is the kan@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land . 
if you want to know how the sea level ris@@ es through ash melt , it flo@@ ws into the sea . 
these ri@@ vers are rapi@@ dly increasing . 
at the other end of the planet , the ant@@ arc@@ tic , the largest ice mass on the planet . 
last month , researchers repor@@ ted that the entire continent now has a negative ice she@@ et . 
and the western ant@@ arc@@ tic , which has sur@@ face@@ d over a few under@@ water is@@ lands , is particularly strong in mel@@ ting . 
this cor@@ respon@@ ds to 20 feet of sea level , like green@@ land . 
in the him@@ al@@ a@@ ya , the third largest ice mass , you can see new la@@ kes above , which were gla@@ ci@@ ers a few years ago . 
40 percent of all people in the world recei@@ ve half of their drin@@ king water from this mel@@ tw@@ ater . 
in the and@@ es , this gla@@ ci@@ er is the source of drin@@ king water for this city . 
the amo@@ unts of water have increas@@ ed . 
but when they dry up , most of the drin@@ king water will disappe@@ ar . 
in california , a 40@@ % redu@@ ction in sie@@ r@@ ra &apos;s s@@ no@@ w@@ pack was seen . 
this concern@@ s the stor@@ age tan@@ ks . 
and the predi@@ ctions as they read them are serious . 
this dr@@ ought throughout the world is leading to a dra@@ matic increase in fir@@ ing . 
and the cat@@ astrop@@ hes around the world have increas@@ ed in a truly extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ dent@@ ed scale . 
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 . 
this is a completely un@@ ten@@ able development pattern . 
if you look at it in histor@@ ical terms , you can see what it does . 
over the past 5 years , we have produced 70 million ton@@ nes of co2 every 24 hours - 25 million ton@@ nes every day in the oceans . 
take a close look at the eastern pacific , from the american continent to the west and both sides of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a dra@@ stic dec@@ line in oxygen in the se@@ as . 
the biggest single factor in global warming , apart from de@@ fore@@ station , which accoun@@ ts for 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fu@@ els . 
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem . 
the united states is one of the two largest pollu@@ ters , along with china . 
and the suggest@@ i@@ on was to build many more coal fac@@ tor@@ ies . 
but we start to see a change . 
here are those who have been can@@ cele@@ d in recent years , with some green alterna@@ tives that have been pro@@ posed . 
despite this , there is a political dis@@ pu@@ te in our country . 
and the coal and oil industri@@ es spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars last cal@@ end@@ ar year pro@@ mot@@ ing clean coal , which in itself is a contra@@ dic@@ tion in terms . 
this picture remin@@ ded me of something . 
around christ@@ mas , at my home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion tons of coal sl@@ u@@ dge ran out . 
you probably saw it in the news . 
this is the second largest waste stream in america in our country . 
this happened around christ@@ mas . 
one of the adverti@@ sing spo@@ ts of the coal industry around christ@@ mas was this . 
fro@@ sty the coal man is a che@@ er@@ ful , happy boy . 
it is in ab@@ und@@ ance in america , and it helps our economy to grow . 
fro@@ sty , the co@@ al@@ man gets cle@@ aner every day . 
it is aff@@ ord@@ able and lo@@ vable , and workers stay in pay and bread . 
this is the source of most coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a . 
the most powerful min@@ er is the head of mas@@ sey coal . 
let me be very clear . al gore , nan@@ cy pe@@ los@@ i , har@@ ry rei@@ d , they do not know what they &apos;re talking about . 
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has launched two campaig@@ ns . 
this is one , part of it . 
at co@@ ale@@ r@@ g@@ y , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business . 
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our top pri@@ ority to spend a si@@ ze@@ able amount of money on a pro@@ mo@@ tional campaign , the truth about coal . 
the fact is , coal is not dir@@ ty . 
we think it is clean - and it sm@@ ells good too 
so , do not worry about the climate change . 
leave it to us . 
sou@@ r coal , they have heard a lot about it . 
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory . 
fantastic ! this machine is pretty lou@@ d . 
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology . 
and although burning coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remark@@ ably clean coal technology you see here is changing everything . 
take a close look , this is today &apos;s clean coal technology . 
finally , the positive alternative mix@@ es with our economic challenge and national security challenge . 
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis . 
the red thre@@ ad that bin@@ ds them all is our depen@@ den@@ cy on carb@@ on-@@ based fu@@ els like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil . 
but now there is a bol@@ d , new solution to free us from this predi@@ cam@@ ent . 
rec@@ over america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years 
a plan to bring america back to work , to make us safe@@ r and to help stop global warming . 
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems . 
rest@@ ore america . find out more . 
this is the last one . 
it &apos;s about a new supply of america . 
one of the fas@@ test ways to reduce our depen@@ den@@ cy on old , dir@@ ty fu@@ els that cho@@ ke our world . 
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system . 
new invest@@ ments to create well-@@ paid jobs . 
rest@@ ore america . it is time to accept reality . 
there is an old african pro@@ verb@@ : &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone . 
if you want to go far , go together . &quot; 
we have to go far and fast . 
many thanks . 
i would like to ask you to think back to the time of your childhood , when you were playing with bri@@ cks . 
as they realized how to stre@@ tch out and access the hands that absor@@ b and move clo@@ gs , they actually learned to think and solve problems by understanding and changing spa@@ tial relationships . 
spa@@ tial thinking is clo@@ sely lin@@ ked to how we understand a large part of our environment . 
as a computer scientist - inspired by the nature of our interaction with real objects - along with my ment@@ or pat@@ ti and my collea@@ gue je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i began to wonder@@ : what if we were to use computers instead of a mouse poin@@ ter that looks like a mouse digital finger@@ ti@@ p moving on a flat work surface . . . . . . what if we could interven@@ e with both hands and physi@@ cally grab data and re@@ ar@@ range it the way we want it@@ ? 
this question was so po@@ ig@@ nant that we decided to research the answer and develop si@@ ft@@ ables . 
in short , a si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer the size of a coo@@ ki@@ e . 
they can be moved by hand , they can percei@@ ve each other , they can capture their movements and they have a screen and a radio recei@@ ver . 
much more im@@ port@@ ant@@ : they are physical , which is why you can move them like building bri@@ cks just by reach@@ ing out and grab@@ bing hands . 
and the si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new generation of tools for manipu@@ lat@@ ing digital data . 
and as these tools become more physical , develop awareness of their movements , recognize each other and percei@@ ve the sub@@ t@@ let@@ ies of our dea@@ lin@@ gs with them , we can begin explor@@ ing new and enter@@ tain@@ ing types of interaction . 
i start with a few simple examples . 
this si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ figured for video play@@ back and if i ti@@ lt it in one direction , the video will be played for@@ war@@ d@@ ; if i ti@@ lt it in the other direction , it run@@ s back@@ wards . 
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its are mu@@ tu@@ ally true . 
so if i put them next to each other , that aro@@ uses their interest . 
when they are surro@@ unded by one another , they notice that too and can get a bit nervous . 
and you feel your movements and in@@ clin@@ ation as well . 
an interesting sequence of inter@@ actions that we began to realize was that we could apply everyday gest@@ ures to data , such as po@@ uring paint as you do with liqu@@ ids . 
in this case , we con@@ figured three si@@ ft@@ ables as color po@@ ts and i can use them to add color to the middle , where they are then mix@@ ed . 
if we over@@ do it , we can po@@ ur back a little . 
there are also some nice opportunities in education such as languages , math or logi@@ c games , where we give the people the possibility of quick trial and er@@ ror and want to see the results immediately . 
here i am . . . this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence that i create with a simple equ@@ ation program . 
this is a game of words that is a mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle . 
basically you get every round rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ sign@@ ed si@@ ft@@ able letters on each si@@ ft@@ able and while trying to form words , these are che@@ cked by a dic@@ tion@@ ary . 
then , after about 30 seconds , it will be mix@@ ed again and you will have a new combin@@ ation of sp@@ ells and new possibilities to try out . 
many thanks . 
these are some children who came on an exc@@ ur@@ sion to the media lab . i was able to get them to try it out and recor@@ ded a video of it . 
they really loved it . 
an interesting fe@@ ature of this type of appli@@ cation is that you do not have to give the people many instru@@ ctions . 
all you have to say is &quot; make words &quot; and they know exactly what to do . 
here are a few more people testing it . 
this is our lat@@ est bet@@ a tes@@ ter down there right . 
it turned out he just wanted to stac@@ k the si@@ ft@@ ables . 
so for him they were just building bri@@ cks . 
this is an inter@@ active trick movie appli@@ cation . 
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language lear@@ ners . 
this is fel@@ i@@ x . 
he can bring new characters into the scene by pic@@ king up the si@@ ft@@ able from the table showing this figure . 
here he lets the sun rise . 
none 
now he is bringing a tra@@ ctor into the scene . 
the orange tra@@ ctor . 
good work ! yes ! 
by sha@@ king the si@@ ft@@ ables and plac@@ ing them next to each other he can let the characters interact . . . 
. . . inven@@ t his own story . 
hell@@ o ! 
it is an open-@@ ended story and it can decide how it develop@@ s . 
flying ca@@ t . 
the last example for which i have time to show it today is a live music sequen@@ cer that we have recently developed , where si@@ ft@@ ables acts as notes , like lead vo@@ cals , bas@@ s and dru@@ ms . 
each has four different vari@@ a@@ tion@@ s@@ ; you can choose which one you want to use . 
and you can feed these sounds into the sequence , which in turn you can ar@@ range in any pattern . 
and you feed them by simply holding a sound si@@ ft@@ able to a sequence si@@ ft@@ able . 
there are effects that you can change live , such as . hall and filter . 
you connect it with a certain ton@@ e and then tend to ad@@ just it . 
and then high@@ er-@@ level effects such as temp@@ o and volu@@ me , which apply to the entire sequence . 
so let &apos;s have a look . 
we start by feed@@ ing the lead vo@@ cal into two sequence si@@ ft@@ ables and ar@@ ran@@ ging them in a row , expan@@ ding them and add@@ ing a bit more to the voice . 
now i add a bas@@ s . 
now i will do some more dru@@ ms . 
and now i connect the filter with the dru@@ ms , so i can control the effect live . 
i can acceler@@ ate the whole sequence by ti@@ l@@ ting the temp@@ o in one direction or the other . 
and now i connect the filter with the bas@@ s@@ ; for something more expression . 
i can change the sequence as it run@@ s . 
i do not have to plan it in advan@@ ce , but can impro@@ vis@@ e@@ ; to len@@ g@@ then or shor@@ ten them during this time . 
and finally i can fa@@ de out the whole sequence by ti@@ l@@ ting the volu@@ me si@@ ft@@ able to the left . 
many thanks . 
so , as you can see , my passion is to develop new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that better match how our brains and bodies work . 
and today i had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we are working on in our lab . 
the thought i want to give them is that we are at the thre@@ sho@@ ld of this new generation of digital media interaction tools that bring information into our world that meet@@ s our needs . 
many thanks , 
i look forward to talking to you all@@ ! 
yes , good day . 
i am gla@@ d that i am here . 
so , what should bio@@ ha@@ cking be@@ ? 
first of all , i have to go back a bit , and that is pre@@ cis@@ ely what bio@@ ha@@ cking is doing with modern molecular biology . 
i &apos;m studying molecular biology and have been involved in bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , and that &apos;s what i started because i just wanted to know more and , above all , wanted to do what i learned in my studies . 
so , that was my primary motivation . 
so it was a curi@@ osity and i wanted to somehow get closer to the matter , so . 
i think that molecular biology in general now , in general terms , bio@@ technology , everything that coun@@ ts , syn@@ thetic biology and so on@@ , 
extremely important , is already extremely important and much , much more important will be in the future . 
there are such contro@@ versi@@ al matters as all these gene@@ tically modi@@ fied plants on the fields . 
there is now cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the u .@@ s .@@ a , which tries to produce bio@@ fuel , that is gas@@ oli@@ ne from alg@@ a@@ e . 
then there are already things that have arrived totally in everyday life , which most people are un@@ aware of , for example deter@@ gent enzy@@ mes that allow us to was@@ h with fort@@ y degrees of laun@@ dry are also gene@@ tically optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes . 
and the list can be continu@@ ed end@@ less@@ ly . 
and so out of the interest in it , in this at this technology , i just went further there . 
so why ha@@ ck no@@ w@@ ? 
most people know most people know this from the software sector . 
computer ha@@ cking , and then it is in the media always so , yes , the ha@@ cker break in somewhere and ste@@ al data and so on . 
that is somehow very sad for the ha@@ cker scene , because that does not really hit what she actually started like that and what &apos;s actually behind it . 
in the se@@ venti@@ es and eig@@ ht@@ ies , the software ha@@ cker@@ s started with computer cra@@ ft@@ ing and the internet was born out of this . 
and it &apos;s about solving a problem in a play@@ ful , creative , original way . 
and problem , this is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be simply a problem of access , what simpli@@ fy things like things , so any problem , raise a question , and how can you do it differently or how can to do it better . 
and it just became it &apos;s just gotten software , but there is also in the electro@@ ni@@ cs field , as there is also a whole craft scene that make all sorts of crazy things with electr@@ onic circu@@ its . 
and now , biology too , and i would like to take this metaphor , which comes from syn@@ thetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because , the dna code is an abstra@@ ct code , which , yes , it is not quite same as computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic because it &apos;s matter , it &apos;s real , not just cy@@ ber . 
but it is also a code , and you can also program it and you can also ha@@ ck it , that way , and i found that i find it incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get into it much more deeply . 
that actually only two thousand eight really took shape , these networks . 
there is ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , that is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , that is with europe and with co@@ operation in india based network , which mean@@ while has members or active people all over the world . 
those are a more arti@@ stic direction , so there goes &apos;@@ ; s are many artists and philosoph@@ ers and , in collaboration with scientists , bus@@ y with dealing with these technologies and asking questions and process@@ ing them crea@@ tively , there are museum exhi@@ bi@@ tions and yes , all sorts of things . 
but it &apos;s always about finding such a cas@@ ual way to have such a play@@ ful way of dealing with it . 
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g , d .@@ i .@@ y .@@ bi@@ o . 
this is from the u .@@ s .@@ a a network , which is actually more of a kind of for@@ um , where where you just meet and discus@@ s online . 
they are a bit more techni@@ cally ori@@ ented and also a bit more busin@@ ess@@ like on the way , because then so , yes applied questions are asked . 
and starting from these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene has developed that i would like to portra@@ y for a short time . 
here in the picture on the top left you can see bio@@ curious , this is a ha@@ cker@@ space , so in principle a kind of school , so a private school , non-@@ profit associ@@ ation , where everyone can get there . 
children , old , all sorts of people go there just to deal with it , they have set up a laboratory and look at what can be done , if these laboratory proto@@ col@@ s . 
here below on the left is a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia called %house-of-natural-fibers , but they have been around for quite some time . 
already longer than these other two networks . 
they also deal with such an arti@@ stic aspe@@ ct with biological materials and , yes , also with electro@@ ni@@ cs , and combin@@ e this in a rather dis@@ si@@ pat@@ ed way . 
a group of ank@@ ar@@ a , whom i met a while ago , who have that is a group of students who just wanted to con@@ vey more to the public , what they learn in un@@ i , and they have done so on street festi@@ val@@ s small actions and people trying to explain what dna is . 
and i have a lec@@ ture on the other picture in cop@@ enha@@ gen in the medical museum in combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion on the top@@ ic . 
and that is , yes that &apos;s usually pretty young people , but the only thing that really uni@@ tes everyone is this fascin@@ ation with technology . 
and what you can do with it and just specifically to approach and ask society , so , okay , what do you know , what do you want to do , are you interested in getting involved with it@@ ? 
so , o .@@ k , to ha@@ ck biology now , you need somehow material . 
of course you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory . 
or , what one usually under@@ stands by a laboratory , these are somehow fre@@ ak@@ y machines , extremely expensive , extremely dist@@ ant , only for speci@@ alist staf@@ f , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with a doc@@ tor@@ ate and so on . 
and our approach was just to say , o .@@ k , that actually you do not have to do that . 
this is not really necessary because every one of every coffee machine actually has more advanced technology than most lab equipment , that &apos;s really true . 
and s o with this pre@@ mis@@ e , for example , brian de@@ g@@ ger in england tried to put together a %minimallaboratory , then took a ste@@ am pressure coo@@ ker , a hot@@ plat@@ e and , yes , so sou@@ p bro@@ th , and then it bre@@ d bacteria , works . 
so anyone who has ever had a sou@@ p that has been left standing for too long has done so before . 
i then tried in my lab at home , a little expan@@ d , and then i bought so secon@@ d-@@ hand equipment on e@@ bay and a little dna analysis made , trying a pat@@ ern@@ ity test , so so / dna finger@@ prin@@ ting , again make at home . 
that should not be a jo@@ ke right now , but . 
down here in the picture you can see the lab , in quot@@ es , so is a garage with so all the possible laboratory ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h , the un@@ i has mu@@ cked out , a group in paris , which is what something has establi@@ shed and quite successful with it and also makes quite interesting things , because i want to cut even a project short . 
and this is bio@@ curious , the just mentioned ha@@ cker@@ space , this yes , so a kind of fol@@ k high school in principle for molecular biology . 
and yes , well , you see , it is relatively relatively he@@ ter@@ ogen@@ e@@ ous , so that &apos;s just the kind of people who do it alone at home , to large organizations that are more forma@@ l in form@@ ality . 
but always always the approach that it should just be easy and acc@@ essi@@ ble . 
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became more and more aware of ourselves , ok , there is us here as a real scene too , and we are online , and we know the people who are always cha@@ tting there and so . 
and then just came from the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o or@@ g website of the foun@@ der , and said ok , we also really have to meet , even meet real , and then organized two events , one in london , two thousand ten , and shor@@ tly there@@ after in the us , in san francisco . 
and , there it was also about , yes o .@@ k , who are we , what do we want , what do we want and what do we want to communic@@ ate@@ ? 
and what are our values ​​and what are our goals , our bas@@ is@@ ? 
and then we worked out such a co@@ de-@@ of-@@ conduc@@ t . 
that was quite intui@@ tive , so everyone just expres@@ sed his wis@@ hes , his and that which moves him , then , then . 
there came , in my opini@@ on , a very good code . 
and then we have that is not bin@@ ding , but that &apos;s just yes , i think so , has pre@@ vail@@ ed relatively well , the people are quite convinced of so . 
and we even tried to bring that back to the acade@@ mic world , but it did not work out that way . 
so i think we from the bio@@ ha@@ cker scene are in fact even a step further than the acade@@ mic world . 
yes , what kind of projects are we doing no@@ w@@ ? 
a project that i did myself with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land was that we wanted to make a so-@@ called opti@@ cal tra@@ p or opti@@ cal tw@@ ee@@ zer@@ s . 
that is , when you focus a las@@ er be@@ am on one in space , then you can capture it with small particles in the air or in the liquid and then move in that focus , so that is then cap@@ tured there , so like a like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am in principle . 
that really works , it &apos;s done in the acade@@ mic setting , and then we thought , ok , maybe we &apos;ll get it , then we took a web@@ ca@@ m , scre@@ wed it on , made the len@@ s , turned it over , then we got a microscop@@ e , which mag@@ nifi@@ ed it four hundred times . 
you can see that down there . 
and then we uns@@ cre@@ wed a d .@@ v .@@ d bur@@ ner and the bur@@ ner out of the las@@ er and then tried to focus on this camera there . 
unfortunately , that did not work , but we still learned a lot from it . 
so another project , that from the french group out there paris , that worked , that &apos;s pretty cool . 
and he has such a well , such a bra@@ in@@ wave meter , so e .@@ e .@@ g or something , so he &apos;s been bus@@ y with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck . 
he then made this this this hel@@ met , and in co@@ operation with the museum that went . 
then the visi@@ tors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , put on this hel@@ met . 
then their bra@@ in@@ waves were measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought or how they thought , then different lights in the room were approach@@ ed . 
it was a pretty cool project . 
another thing from the us , which also has to do with this pat@@ ern@@ ity test history , is the p .@@ c .@@ r , which is the poly@@ mer@@ ase chain reaction , complex word . 
it is a matter of simply cop@@ ying , multi@@ pl@@ ying , and multi@@ pl@@ ying frag@@ ments , so that they can be made visible . 
so if i do that now the profi@@ ler@@ s at the scene , then go there , collect some hair sam@@ ples , and then they &apos;ll do that method , and then they can say , o .@@ k , that hair belo@@ n@@ gs to that human , so . 
and the machines that do that are pretty expensive , the ones you buy commer@@ cially , the che@@ ap@@ est ones start at four thousand euro@@ s . 
and that &apos;s not in the ho@@ bby area , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can do a lot too . 
so that &apos;s just one appli@@ cation of many that you can do with it . 
and they have set up two so two hand@@ y@@ men and said , ok , we make it easier and che@@ aper , and then just from open source , so free@@ ly available hard@@ ware , electro@@ ni@@ cs , this device %zusammengebastelt and are now even have that brought to market and are now the che@@ ap@@ est supp@@ lie@@ r of these devices worldwide . 
i think it &apos;s about six hundred dollars or something . 
but in any case it is now it is still not cheap , but it is definitely in a frame where it becomes more available . 
so it is in my opini@@ on a very successful ha@@ ck . 
a project i had started recently was to build a gene@@ -@@ gun . 
gene gun is , yes , like some kind of air gun , which sho@@ ots about as far as two in@@ ches or so . 
d .@@ n .@@ a lo@@ ads on gold particles and the gold particles then in this air pressure gun , and then i shot them on oni@@ ons and then made it shi@@ ne with it like that . 
so the device that you see there , that did not work . 
but that &apos;s my prototyp@@ e , but it looked pretty bad , so on top of that , the thing on it , electro@@ ni@@ cs and pressure connected , and that was the pressure was too high , the thing broke . 
and then i took a crea@@ m don@@ or and connected it . 
a crea@@ m dis@@ pen@@ ser , if you fill it up with water , it will have enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s about fort@@ y to six@@ te@@ en on it . 
and then you can then acceler@@ ate the particles strong enough and then go into the oni@@ on pur@@ ely . 
and the commercial device will cost about fif@@ te@@ en thousand euro@@ s or something like that , crea@@ m dis@@ pen@@ ser@@ s around the fif@@ ty . 
so it does not have the same efficiency , but it is basically fe@@ asi@@ ble . 
at the moment this is just the core conc@@ ern of the scene , to increase this avail@@ ability of technology and to increase the information and the %comprehensibility that more people can get involved there . 
because , as it said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of ​​it and no chance to get there really well . 
because , if you only read about it , from secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature , that is not the same as having done it yourself or seen it once . 
and i think technology is becoming more and more important in our modern societies . 
and if , as an infor@@ med citi@@ zen , you also want to be able to make meaning@@ ful decisions in society , then you need access to knowledge and technology . 
and and you have to do it and understand it in order to do it and understand it . 
and that then goes by the slo@@ gan open knowledge and citi@@ zen science . 
so that just as a citi@@ zen is en@@ ab@@ led to deal with these scientific technologies . 
and that is the core conc@@ ern of the bio@@ ha@@ cker@@ s . 
these are the people who at least offi@@ cially regi@@ stere@@ d on the website , di@@ y-@@ bio@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g-@@ website . 
that &apos;s a relatively consi@@ der@@ able number of people worldwide . 
and it is also interesting that they are also repres@@ ented in sou@@ the@@ ast asia . 
that is i think they are there are fewer people regi@@ stere@@ d than actually exist . 
so i know of some who have not regi@@ stere@@ d . 
and now these are just the bio@@ ha@@ cker@@ s , the individual people . 
sometimes with these ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so these places together regi@@ stere@@ d there . 
and that is in the beginning . 
as i said , two thousand eight it has just be@@ gun . 
and ha@@ cker@@ spaces , the computer ha@@ cker@@ spaces , since the c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , nin@@ et@@ ee@@ n nin@@ et@@ y-@@ five . 
and that has now become a gigan@@ tic network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers that are repres@@ ented all over the world . 
and we hope , of course , that we will expan@@ d and then simil@@ arly well net@@ worked , so that more people can be involved . 
and i would invi@@ te everyone to deal with it and to try something for themselves . 
it may not be so simple , but it is not impossible , if you have enough curi@@ osity and enough energy , then you get there too . 
thanks for listening . 
that was &apos;@@ ; s . 
yes hell@@ o . 
how do we humans actually work@@ ? 
that is a question that moves me a lot as a designer , but also in the field of us@@ ability and above all in the field of user experience . 
it &apos;s about meeting people in inter@@ active media so that they can use these inter@@ active media and create the most satis@@ fying experience possible . 
i believe that the inter@@ active media in us address arch@@ ai@@ c , cognitive models , that is , patterns of thinking that have been program@@ med into our biological memory for a very , very long time , and that we can re@@ create them through inter@@ active media . 
and that is very amazing , because you actually believe that this high technology that you en@@ coun@@ ter there , that actually brings one into the future , but in fact it is so that the future is right here with us , with our arch@@ ai@@ c roots . 
what are actually arch@@ ai@@ c mod@@ el@@ s@@ ? 
i once wrote four key@@ words and would like to explain the short . 
arch@@ ai@@ c cognitive models are the models that we ac@@ qui@@ red in pre-@@ industrial times . 
one of these arch@@ ai@@ c models is that we have a princi@@ pal@@ ly natural relationship to virtu@@ ality . 
that sounds fundament@@ ally unusual at first . 
i &apos;ll go back to that and will try to prove to you that you , too , have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality . 
the second aspe@@ ct is that , because of these arch@@ ai@@ c models , we are quite able to speak very figu@@ ra@@ tively , although we now use a co@@ di@@ fied language . 
and the third area , which actually explains itself . 
we all know that the inter@@ active media are by definition non-@@ lin@@ ear , which impli@@ es the nega@@ tion of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and which , of course , tells us that lin@@ ear@@ ity today is normal . 
the fourth point is that the story is a place of information sharing for us . 
what about the virtu@@ ality that is actually the most natural thing in the world@@ ? 
i want to prove it to you . 
how many do@@ ors does the house where you live li@@ ve@@ ? 
we will not immediately be able to answer that spon@@ tane@@ ously , but the following will happen and is happening right now . 
they go through the house in which they live , and look at how many do@@ ors there are . 
and that is exactly what they do . 
they virtu@@ alize reality without any computer . 
fantastic , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
and there we try to present the virtual reality in our v .@@ r .@@ -@@ lab , for example , at the medi@@ a-@@ cam@@ pus , but we can actually do that all the time . 
and this virtual reality virtu@@ alize the virtual , the people in the pre-@@ industrial times also needed bit@@ ter@@ ly , because they had nothing . 
they did not have any books . 
or they did not have any fo@@ tol@@ it@@ ograph@@ y . 
they had no mass media . 
the only thing they had was their head . 
and in this mind , the memory took place . 
in this head has been re@@ trie@@ ved knowledge and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , have just been know also passed . 
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so roo@@ ted in us that we can hand@@ le virtu@@ ality so well . 
the interesting thing is , if i may make a little trip . 
that &apos;s fine . 
the interesting thing is that at that time man was both a media produ@@ cer and medium himself . 
if they think a bit further now . 
what are media to@@ da@@ y@@ ? 
then you will notice that there has been a change . 
but i &apos;ll come back to that again . 
an essential tool of information trans@@ fer has always been history . 
sha@@ man@@ s , pri@@ ests , so-@@ called knowledge guar@@ ds , were speci@@ ally turned off to keep their stories in the know . 
and even today we are still very , very hea@@ vil@@ y attac@@ hed to stories . 
according to the auth@@ or of the story@@ telling animal , jon@@ ath@@ an got@@ tsch@@ all , we still spend one thousand and nine hundred hours a year reading stories . 
this means for a child who , before reach@@ ing the age of majority , has spent most of his life in the re@@ ception of stories . 
now we think our love of stories depen@@ ds on having sat on our par@@ ent &apos;s la@@ p as a child . 
no , no , far from it . 
that goes back much further , into the cultures of pre-@@ industrial times . 
but for me in the field of inter@@ active media , it is particularly impres@@ sive that we have an@@ cho@@ red ourselves in our biological memory per se , the ability to think non@@ lin@@ early . 
i brought you an example from the north american tri@@ be of no@@ ot@@ ka indi@@ ans . 
and the lives lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia . 
and as you can see , this is a very is@@ land@@ -@@ rich area and you had to navi@@ gate somehow , from island to island to get food . 
and they did that with so-@@ called lead maps . 
you may know that , too , if you &apos;re interested in it , from the austr@@ ali@@ an ab@@ origin@@ es . 
they have similar principles . 
they have no lead maps , but they have used the so-@@ called son@@ gli@@ nes or trau@@ mp@@ fa@@ de . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that the navi@@ gation and top@@ ograph@@ y of regi@@ ons could be ma@@ pped over songs . 
where the language was sub@@ ordin@@ ate to sub@@ ordin@@ ate ran@@ k . 
that is , one navi@@ gat@@ ed through sounds and over rhyth@@ m . 
and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m have repres@@ ented the ge@@ ology , the top@@ ograph@@ y of a region and this of course also made it possible that these songs could de@@ frag@@ ment and put together differently and so could move back to the left , to the right and back to the place of dep@@ art@@ ure . 
why do not we sing anymore to get from top to bot@@ tom@@ ? 
certainly not to navi@@ gate . 
what happen@@ ed@@ ? 
happened that the so-@@ called machine age . 
we moved in the so-@@ called vog@@ t era before . 
the machine age has happened and the book has happened and what happened is photo@@ li@@ to@@ graph@@ y . 
and that is pre@@ cis@@ ely what has happened , that we have shif@@ ted the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and the own production of our individual memor@@ ies to ex@@ ternal media . 
on the book and on the picture . 
unfortunately , we have for@@ gotten how to virtu@@ alize god for a while . 
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become foreign to us and has nothing to do with reality anymore . 
bru@@ ce brown , a well-@@ known design resear@@ cher at bri@@ ght@@ on university , has gone so far as to say that this mass media means the book and the image , not television , the internet , etc . , and so on , what we call mass media today that these mass media have pe@@ tri@@ fied our memor@@ ies and evolved our ability to virtu@@ alize . 
let &apos;s make a small balance . 
from the vog@@ t age to the machine age . 
what influ@@ ences ours on our thinking and on our memor@@ y@@ ? 
then there are the fa@@ ding influ@@ ences of pre@@ industrial cultures . 
and over the cent@@ ur@@ ies , these are being over@@ written more and more by the influ@@ ences of the machine age . 
that is , rather than reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing ourselves individu@@ ally , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , wid@@ e@@ spread patterns of memory in mas@@ ses to which we can attac@@ h our personal memor@@ ies . 
we do not produce ourselves anymore . 
we have an abstra@@ ct abstra@@ ct language . 
we no longer imagine the thing in pictures , the things in pictures no longer , but we co@@ di@@ fy you our language . 
we got used to things happening lin@@ early . 
and we have accep@@ ted lin@@ ear@@ ity as law and there are only exc@@ ep@@ tions , such as non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity . 
what has sta@@ yed with us is story@@ telling . 
we are still very , very stron@@ gl@@ y attac@@ hed to story@@ telling as an information agen@@ cy . 
the question is , what is coming no@@ w@@ ? 
we had the vog@@ t age , we &apos;ve had the machine age , and we &apos;re tre@@ ading on the so-@@ called cy@@ ber era . 
this sounds very spac@@ ey and sounds very science fi@@ ction , i know . 
but these cyber@@ -@@ era concep@@ ts bring us back to those possibilities to re@@ discover our abilities . 
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about story@@ telling . 
i want to explain that a little bit . 
there are technical concep@@ ts such as aug@@ mented reality , that is , aug@@ mented reality . 
so if you look at google glas@@ ses , for example , then there is a concept that lets us re@@ combin@@ e the virtual world with the real world , that is , our aff@@ ini@@ ty for virtu@@ alization , the virtual as something normal , natural , again , 
another example is the so-@@ called virtual reality . 
as crazy as that may sound in the context of my pres@@ entation , we physi@@ cally move in non-@@ exist@@ ent , virtual world@@ s , following the example of the hol@@ od@@ ec@@ k . 
and others another example are the ambi@@ ent , intelligent systems . 
these are spaces that can respond intelligen@@ tly to a person . 
all this needs the ability to accept our fundamental ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real life space . 
i &apos;m in the end and i hope the video works , a very , very nice project brought along , that &apos;s the bac@@ hel@@ or thesis of michael bur@@ k , an@@ na@@ -@@ kat@@ hri@@ n kr@@ enz , jo@@ ri@@ s kla@@ use and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z mul@@ ler . 
and the last two are here today . 
maybe you can get up a bit , so that they can talk about the project with the two during the break . 
and i have brought this project as an example , how is add@@ ressed again to this arch@@ ai@@ c , cognitive models . 
the whole is a game , i have to say . 
which of course comes extremely close to story@@ telling and it is a computer game . 
and when i say computer game , then you probably have in mind that people are fo@@ ol@@ ing people in front of any con@@ sol@@ es or playing with those with some con@@ sol@@ e in their hand . 
in any case , that they do it in there . 
this is a game for out@@ do@@ ors . 
and that is pur@@ pos@@ efully meant for me to discover the outside world , so that i re@@ discover the real world . 
and this game connec@@ ts the virtual world , that is , the data , the data space that we produce , with the real world . 
i apo@@ logi@@ ze for having to cut that short . 
you can explain that much better , there is a lot more behind it . 
the point is that i discover a city by looking at which places were tw@@ ee@@ ted posi@@ tively or nega@@ tively . 
and so i get a completely different view of the city , a completely different impres@@ sion , nam@@ ely , i see negative and positive zon@@ es of a city and th@@ us get in this way a completely different , virtual map of a very real city . 
and we can now look at it . 
ah , what you can see here , exc@@ use me , is a little explan@@ ation of what you are about to see . 
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear . 
and with a kind of fla@@ sh@@ light we can visu@@ alize these virtual world@@ s . 
so , i would like to sum@@ mar@@ ize my talk in the sense that the properties and the skills that we have ac@@ qui@@ red from the vog@@ t age , and that we are so a bit bu@@ ried in the machine age , that with the help of the so-@@ called cy@@ ber age can be re@@ activ@@ ated and that in this way we do not actually come to the future through complex , technological , new products , but actually back to our roots . 
many thanks . 
yes , i am very happy to be with you . 
i &apos;ve just been asked if this ba@@ g is a talking ba@@ g and my will speak instead . 
he will not do that . 
i will also resol@@ ve immediately what &apos;s in there . 
but so far i &apos;m still doing it &apos;@@ ; a bit curious . 
yes , kids are naturally curious or curious , designers too . 
i &apos;m a home@@ -@@ style designer , so of course i &apos;m also interested in the top@@ ic of curi@@ osity and how curi@@ osity is changing our thinking again and why are we also losing curi@@ osity and having to &apos;@@ ; s start again , and so on . 
that is a whole series of things , with which one dea@@ ls be@@ side the actual existence as a designer . 
when profess@@ ors become curious , they often become so &apos;@@ ; n research term pus@@ hed in . 
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had for the past six months . 
a research se@@ mes@@ ter on the top@@ ic of natural user interface design . 
now you &apos;re going to ask , why are all the crea@@ tors starting to deal with such natural , arch@@ ai@@ c primi@@ tives of communication , interaction , etc , and so on . 
and there i hold up only one of these small devices , because things should become more and more intui@@ tive , more natural , more us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly and there you have to look , what is natural for us humans , what is us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive . 
and against the background , i have been in the field of natural user interface design , ie the next generation in the human computer so in the relationship of the human computer dea@@ ls with how our tools or how the computer from the computer success@@ i@@ vely to the digital assi@@ stant changed . 
so i &apos;m bus@@ y , when is something natural or intui@@ tive . 
maybe even have a look behind it . 
why does that happen@@ ? 
so if we look at the development of our society , here brie@@ fly pres@@ ented , then we move now from the third to the fourth generation of society or social form . 
from the modern to the computer society . 
every society is characteri@@ zed by a primary medium . 
in the beginning the tri@@ ba@@ l society by the language . 
that is , one has found one another , by having spo@@ ken a common language one could communicate with one another , has moved into the same ca@@ ve or in other areas , has formed cities or villa@@ ges and has so &apos;@@ ; a tri@@ ba@@ l society so to speak . 
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very li@@ vely . 
you also had to learn , so no to@@ dd@@ ler can speak naturally , but we learn it success@@ i@@ vely and relatively naturally . 
this was then re@@ placed by ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction . 
that was a huge cry at the time , because of course the living language began to mani@@ fest in the form of writing , that is , what is flu@@ id and alive , i start and chi@@ sel it in stone and with that i also manipu@@ late it . 
depen@@ ding on how i chi@@ sel and when i chi@@ sel , it is of course a very different co@@ verage , as if one alive of so to speak of itself . 
but success@@ i@@ vely dre@@ w then just this fo@@ nt as a primary medium , received colle@@ ction . 
then came the next generation , in which we actually still live today . 
that &apos;s just the typ@@ ef@@ ace with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others that is characteri@@ zed by print and print . 
at that time was &apos;@@ ; it &apos;s just an af@@ front where no@@ bility , cle@@ r@@ g@@ y and others have sa@@ i@@ d@@ : are you really ins@@ an@@ e when the people start to read , then they want to have a say later and that &apos;s totally fa@@ tal , of course . 
and now we are getting into the next generation and the exciting thing is , such a generation change is only every few hundred years and we are really in this moment in this phenomen@@ al phase , that we are going to do it . 
of course that totally conf@@ uses us , because on one side we see the new media , soci@@ l social media , facebook etc and so on . 
with the total transpar@@ ency , what the new thinking is , what bang@@ s on the old think , do not say that in the las@@ ag@@ ne horse meat and no bee@@ f is more or other phenomen@@ a , nam@@ ely i just want to cover up and just wants to announ@@ ce . 
and these two world@@ s are just po@@ pping together , new and old thinking . 
the exciting thing is , if you look at it , this new society , this computer society , bor@@ ro@@ wed from many mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ ai@@ c patterns of thinking from that of the tri@@ ba@@ l society . 
but now not on a local level , but on a global level . 
we understand that the weather is global . 
that the top@@ ic of ec@@ ology is global . 
not if i think lo@@ cally eco@@ logi@@ cally and the neighb@@ or thinks less ec@@ ological , then the whole thing does not work anymore . 
that is , the local village has actually become a global village with the same principles , as natural as possible , as intui@@ tive as possible , but also total transpar@@ ency . 
just as we knew back then in the village , who has what with whom and when , this happens today through this exten@@ sion of ourselves through these mobile ter@@ min@@ als on a global level . 
let it be that we know how to accu@@ mul@@ ate glob@@ ally and accu@@ mul@@ ate ever faster and better and better . 
as it used to happen in the village . 
against the background , i &apos;ve just been bus@@ y to look , what does it actually mean , what is still natural for us , what have we also for@@ gotten , but what is also instin@@ ctive for us , so what makes the differ@@ en@@ ce@@ ? 
because people often come , they can &apos;@@ ; do not use it so everyone can hand@@ le it . 
so you have to deal with it , what does that mean , and not just change it , that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to get better . 
and when , of course , is something intui@@ tive and how can i influence it as a designer and just make things accor@@ d@@ ingly , so that they are a us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly , so intui@@ tive as possible , because then they make fun and are easy to use . 
then one dea@@ ls , even during the study , with the top@@ ic of perception and per@@ cep@@ tual psychology . 
and of course that &apos;s where you start and look and say , okay , now i just look inside myself . 
and how does it loo@@ k@@ ? &apos;s actually in there@@ ? 
so how do we work when we look at it@@ ? 
and what does it mean , of course , intui@@ tively and how do our chan@@ nel@@ s of perception work and how does cognitive process@@ ing work@@ ? 
because steve jobs once said you need to dig deeper to understand how it works . 
so you really have to look in detail , if i want to make something us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively mana@@ ge@@ able , what does that mean in the core . 
and you can already see that you are one of our seven sen@@ ses , most think we have only five , mean@@ while &apos;@@ ; even though we have already accep@@ ted seven , the next , eig@@ ht@@ h sense will sur@@ ely be add@@ ed in the near future , and as an exten@@ sion of ourselves again . 
and to see how we process information , how do we collect informa@@ tion@@ ? 
to say alone , what is informa@@ tion@@ ? 
information is any difference that makes a difference . 
many use the word , but do not know what it means in detail . 
but i have to understand in the core , to understand in the world , when will information become information , when will i get information from information and from information in turn , so that i know how i can make things intui@@ tively or naturally mana@@ ge@@ able after@@ wards . 
and of course , how does design influence the perception . 
we see this when i create things , then i can make them conf@@ using like on the right side , where i do not know what is sal@@ t and pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can make them quas@@ i intui@@ tive by showing things . 
so much more natural , in a ves@@ sel , but i see , so to speak , directly , where is sal@@ t and pe@@ pp@@ er in it . 
and if i tell someone , give me some sal@@ t or pe@@ pp@@ er , then he will think at the right first , where is something inside . 
and the left just intui@@ tively access and then i hope that there is no sugar in it , the sal@@ t just give accor@@ d@@ ingly . 
but also our perception itself , how wrong it is for us . 
for example , this perception in context . 
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , although that is not the case , but they are just the same size , and yet our perception changes depen@@ ding on the context in which we put things in . 
does anyone know what that is ? 
come on . 
pattern recogni@@ tion should still work . 
there is &apos;@@ ; it &apos;s more like my glas@@ ses . 
so it is &apos;@@ ; n circle . 
a second circle already begins to cor@@ rela@@ te or associ@@ ate certain simil@@ ari@@ ty . 
and when i stop to add a hal@@ f-@@ o@@ val , we suddenly no longer see just one more unit , nam@@ ely circle , circle and , but we see a unity , we no longer see three parts , one circle , one circle , another . 
this is what is called gest@@ alt law or gest@@ alt psychology , which in turn also influ@@ ences us in perception . 
important for the designers , who usually have the first se@@ mes@@ ter , the great gest@@ alt@@ ges@@ et@@ ze . 
design law of pro@@ xi@@ mit@@ y , design law of continu@@ ity and so on . 
often for@@ gotten in the third then again . 
but that is an essential part of making things as intui@@ tive as possible . 
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting that of seeing . 
sounds ban@@ al at first , but is accor@@ d@@ ingly exciting , if one dea@@ ls with it more clo@@ sely . 
so we have the eyes in the front and now they think , we see from front to back . 
that is wrong . 
they see first from the back to the front . 
nam@@ ely , they project an assu@@ mption forward , that they see something that they recognize , for example circle . 
that is , we first project our vision before we see it , then bring it back into our vision machine , to say , ok@@ a@@ y@@ , 
i &apos;m like this &apos;@@ ; a cognitive feedback , you &apos;ve proje@@ cted what you want to see . 
that is there too , that comes back then . 
then goes &apos;@@ ; s back to the front , because the re@@ ar does not trust the front and says , now really please look again and make sure if what you see , that &apos;s what you want to see . 
and then go &apos;@@ ; s back and then &apos;@@ ; s actually seen . 
so a very , very exciting process , how certain things happen and in what milli@@ second areas these things happen . 
i do not know who of you knows this picture . 
there happens exactly the same thing that i just described . 
now everyone is trying to recognize something from this pattern . 
i do not know who recogni@@ zes what . 
does anyone see something speci@@ fi@@ c@@ ? 
a da@@ l@@ mati@@ an , exactly . 
once i &apos;ve seen that , that there is a da@@ l@@ mati@@ an in there , then they know that . 
you will be &apos;@@ ; i &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;ll show you where the da@@ l@@ mati@@ an is . 
now you see the da@@ l@@ mati@@ an . 
and on , now they always see him . 
that is , i have now spo@@ iled them to the point that they no longer recognize no pattern in it , but i have condi@@ tioned them within a very short time , again and again to see this dog in this conf@@ used image . 
and that is this proje@@ ction of seeing , feedback , seeing . 
now i know &apos;@@ ; s and now i &apos;m proje@@ cting forward that i see the da@@ l@@ mati@@ an . 
i see the da@@ l@@ mati@@ an . 
so very , very exciting processes , which then in this , yes , gra@@ y is not really , but just here in this pin@@ k mass just run accor@@ d@@ ingly . 
does anyone know what three seconds are@@ ? 
long , yes . 
that is our present . 
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer . 
if i know , something takes three seconds , until i sort of out of the present in the past loo@@ p , then i can also bridge very good waiting times , in which i always emplo@@ y him by keeping someone with three seconds . 
he has to process that as a present . 
then it goes into the past and th@@ us i can bridge very elegan@@ t waiting times for example at the computer , if i know this phenomenon . 
what takes tw@@ ent@@ y five milli@@ secon@@ d@@ s@@ ? 
yes , milli@@ seconds . 
also a very exciting phenomenon . 
this is the period in which one falls in love . 
that means , be@@ ware , if you know that now , pay attention to who you look at for how long , because i do not take responsibility for what can happen then . 
and six@@ te@@ en milli@@ seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon . 
that &apos;s the period of most of the per@@ cep@@ tions that we have . 
that is , this first impres@@ sion happens at a rapi@@ d rate of speed as we percei@@ ve things . 
and how we see things , what we pay attention to , and how we protect ourselves , so to speak , against our environment so that we can think it over . 
of course , the designers are not only concerned with the subject of per@@ cep@@ tions and neur@@ onal process@@ ing or cogni@@ tion er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , but pri@@ mar@@ ily with the subject of the human@@ -@@ object relationship . 
so how does a person deal with certain thin@@ gs@@ ? 
there are once %product-language practical func@@ tions , so forma@@ l aspe@@ cts or forma@@ l a@@ es@@ thetic aspe@@ cts . 
there are sign func@@ tions , where i know exactly where i have to reach . 
but there are also symbo@@ lic func@@ tions , why is someone for such a small po@@ u@@ ch , where hard@@ ly anything fit@@ s in anyway , so hor@@ ren@@ dou@@ s bu@@ cks of money , although it is not so practic@@ al@@ ? 
there we are more on the symbo@@ lic , on the level of meaning , with which we as a designer of course also deal . 
back to my actual top@@ ic natural user interface and the top@@ ic , which of course also lies behind us@@ ability . 
us@@ ability always means how can i reach a certain goal as quickly as possible or how can a user achieve a goal as effectively , effici@@ ently and satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily as possible in a given context of use . 
says so &apos;@@ ; it &apos;s more the nor@@ m . 
how can i make something as us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly as possi@@ ble@@ ? 
can i serve that directly or do i need it &apos;@@ ; n manu@@ al or do i need &apos;@@ ; ne appropriate training for it . 
and less us@@ able or easy to use . 
the fact that i only make it different and more beautiful does not mean that it is easier to hand@@ le . 
you also have to understand that . 
and if you then look at the software that we have just seen , then you will also understand why nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of our current software is not very intui@@ tive or not immediately us@@ able , the i@@ -@@ pad in many areas or i@@ -@@ phone accor@@ d@@ ingly inclu@@ ded , though &apos;@@ ; s is much more intui@@ tive than classi@@ c software . 
intui@@ tive us@@ ability is not just an element@@ ary economic factor since apple , an element@@ ary success factor , if i just want to har@@ ness technological devices to people . 
why ? 
because , as a rule , this new type of us@@ ability , ie the natural user inter@@ faces , means that we are five times faster on average at our dest@@ ination . 
you have to imagine that if you make some of the classi@@ c soft@@ war@@ es you will need five hours and with this new kind of natural software you only need one more hour . 
this does not mean that you will probably be allowed to go home four hours later , but your employe@@ r or somebody will think of how to work with them for four hours . 
but i want to say that for us it is of course a cor@@ respon@@ ding increase in performance , to achieve certain things . 
so , when we go back into the software area , here are the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces , which were very abstra@@ ct , where it took months to deal with these systems . 
then came the next ones who are already with &apos;@@ ; a neur@@ al model or mental model like the software ee@@ r@@ gon@@ om@@ ists say they have worked , nam@@ ely , one would have an idea of ​​something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a des@@ kt@@ op to har@@ ness the computer . 
so no longer zer@@ os and ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but just a metaphor . 
that made the whole much easier to use , but of course it is much better . 
the next generation of graphi@@ cal user inter@@ faces is already much more of a behavi@@ oral one . 
so as a designer , i make it a lot more habit@@ ual than looking that way . 
that is also a paradig@@ m shift . 
that all of a sudden , it seems that the us@@ ability of an appli@@ cation becomes ever less important for success . 
and if i then go one step further into these natural user inter@@ faces , where i have to control the things by voice , by voice , by touch , by gest@@ ure and no longer by mouse and cur@@ sor , then i &apos;m even faster and even more immedi@@ ate . 
but that also leads me back to the point , when will things actually become more intui@@ tiv@@ e@@ ? 
if you become more intui@@ tive and then i have to stra@@ in my little friend here again and look , what does that mean in terms of cogni@@ tion er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , when is something really intui@@ tiv@@ e@@ ? 
and that &apos;s for us humans is always a bit intui@@ tive , if i have to think about as little as possible . 
so appar@@ ently he does not like to think , but to make it relatively easy . 
the less i think about it , so to speak , the more intui@@ tive it is . 
and what does that mean for the desig@@ ner@@ ? 
that is , if we look at the fact that we can trans@@ fer exist@@ ing models of action from one to something else , for example the metaphor , then i can take advantage of that as a designer . 
that is , i can just as an intui@@ tive , human action model on a software trans@@ fer and th@@ us make the software much easier to use . 
of course , the question ari@@ ses , what is actually the most intui@@ tive sche@@ me of action of us humans and now i have &apos;@@ ; s already betra@@ yed . 
this is the so-@@ called o@@ sit model . 
each of us uses that and o@@ sit is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m and stands for ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , infor@@ m , trans@@ act . 
every one of them does that all the time , but he does &apos;@@ ; s un@@ conscious and yes almost intui@@ tive or sometimes instin@@ ctive . 
the model is already pro@@ no@@ un@@ ced in the wom@@ b and is inter@@ cultural , so it works glob@@ ally among young and old , and is used by us all the time without most of us knowing that this model exists . 
o@@ sit o@@ sit in itself is about fif@@ ty to se@@ vent@@ y thousand times of us depen@@ ding on activity , so in the sleep one has found that it is then less frequ@@ ently stra@@ ined than during the day . 
i can now ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , infor@@ m , trans@@ act and trans@@ fer this mental action model to an interaction system . 
and through this type of trans@@ fer , similar to the metaphor of the des@@ kt@@ ops , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , of a principle of action . 
and that is at a higher gra@@ il of us@@ ability than that of trans@@ mitt@@ ing a classi@@ c metaphor , nam@@ ely that of the des@@ kt@@ ops . 
and if i transl@@ ate this now , for example , in which i express ori@@ entation as an over@@ view , sele@@ ct as a sele@@ ction , infor@@ m in the case , it comes big to me , i can &apos;@@ ; s looking at me in detail , and yes , trans@@ acting means i can throw it somewhere or send someone or shop it and so on@@ , 
then i can trans@@ fer the whole thing . 
i &apos;ll try that with an example . 
everyone has already e@@ aten ca@@ ke . 
sur@@ ve@@ y@@ : now i interact with the object so to speak , can zo@@ om out again , zo@@ om in . 
i get the whole over@@ view , can now filter on it and can say , just show me everything with cho@@ col@@ ate , for example . 
and suddenly have an interface , which is much more intui@@ tive and much more natural . 
because the fact that i can gras@@ p the things like the bits and pieces , and they approach me , is much more natural than through hier@@ archi@@ cally organized web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms , so to speak , to make these things acc@@ essi@@ ble . 
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with this sentence i would like to close , a and again to give the hin@@ t , even designers have to think differently in order to come up with new solutions , and in this sense , i sin@@ cer@@ ely thank you for your attention and please . 
i want to help you with a very specific aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity . 
the first , when you grow up as a child , as a baby , is that you care about what exc@@ reti@@ ons you have , ye@@ s@@ ? and depen@@ ding on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in your po@@ tty and to sti@@ r , the more , so to speak , your curi@@ osity will of course be aro@@ used . 
and the curi@@ osity can not be learned . 
therefore , all who are here and curious are in fact people who have a property that one can not learn . 
my conc@@ ern now is to transl@@ ate practic@@ ally this entire environmental discussion , the end of the world , fort@@ y years of clu@@ b@@ -@@ of-@@ roman@@ ce , into quality . 
and there is a central point here . 
and it depen@@ ds on phosp@@ ho@@ r . 
give pe@@ e a chance . 
every day they give + order of mag@@ ni@@ tude about two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us and every day you need to take two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us . 
otherwise you can not have teeth . 
you can not save energy . 
you can not have bon@@ es . 
we could only gli@@ de through the oceans as amo@@ r@@ pho@@ us mol@@ lu@@ sc@@ s . 
if in fact we do not absor@@ b and rele@@ ase phosp@@ hor@@ us . 
surpris@@ ingly , we are dealing with something here , which is actually &apos;@@ ; it would be obvious , but not at all . 
because everyone is talking about energy , but nobody talks about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem . 
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical . 
we depen@@ d on two countries . 
we only have phosp@@ hor@@ us for two years and already phosp@@ hor@@ us min@@ ing is bringing more ur@@ ani@@ um into the environment worldwide than is used in all atom@@ ic plants . 
in the last tw@@ ent@@ y years alone , fif@@ te@@ en thousand tons of ur@@ ani@@ um have been distribu@@ ted on our fields in germany . 
and we take it all in . 
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children . 
and we think we would protect the environment if we are a little less har@@ m@@ ful . 
so , for example , protect the environment , drive less car . 
protect the environment , make less gar@@ bag@@ e . 
protect the environment , use less energy . 
but that is no protection . 
that &apos;s the way i say , protect your child , just beat it three times instead of five times . 
that &apos;s just a little less destruction . 
if we think so from cra@@ d@@ le to gra@@ ve , then our whole earth will so@@ one@@ r or later become a ce@@ met@@ ery . 
therefore to think of cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le . 
and the most important thing is to look at the ground , as the very first . 
over six@@ ty percent of the carbon is stor@@ ed in the soil . 
at the moment we grow cor@@ n and lose between ele@@ ven and thir@@ ty kil@@ ogra@@ ms thir@@ ty tons per he@@ ct@@ are , or on the square meter also conver@@ t . 
that is , we lose about five thousand times more in the ground than is new@@ ly formed . 
of course we can first look at the gar@@ bag@@ e problem . 
and everything is pac@@ ka@@ ging or content . 
in offen@@ bac@@ h , for example , house@@ hold waste accoun@@ ts for tw@@ ent@@ y percent of the gar@@ bag@@ e amount in the mean@@ time . 
and as we get older , the di@@ ap@@ ers get bigger . 
that is they are all , so to speak , in the pre-@@ di@@ aper phase . 
yes ? 
a baby needs about six thousand di@@ ap@@ ers . 
of course , we could reduce that by ten percent , but what does it mat@@ ter@@ ? 
this will be comp@@ ens@@ ated in one second in china . 
that is completely ir@@ relevant . 
the question is , how do we deal with these di@@ a@@ pers@@ ? 
by the way , this is a pro@@ of that men are not pig@@ s . 
i want to tell you . 
because phosp@@ hor@@ us is given off at pig@@ s by soli@@ d const@@ it@@ u@@ ents exc@@ re@@ ments . 
in humans over the ur@@ ine . 
yes . 
so that men can not be pig@@ s . 
because that &apos;s so bus@@ y , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
tradition@@ ally we think in the environmental debate , we are too many in the world . 
and if you tell people that if you den@@ y people to exist , if you say that &apos;s better , you &apos;re not there , then they become gre@@ ed@@ y and ho@@ sti@@ le . 
and so someone like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es , says there is nothing more important than stabili@@ zing the human population . 
in israel , when you save a human life , you say that you are saving the earth . 
here it says , the more you kill , the better . 
yes . 
the first question is , are we really too man@@ y@@ ? 
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the earth , then the ants wei@@ gh about four times more than we humans . 
i could also take ter@@ mit@@ e , but in the usa , nobody lik@@ es ter@@ mit@@ es , in so far as they are vege@@ tar@@ i@@ ans . 
that is , the ants wei@@ gh much more than we do . 
and because they work much harder physi@@ cally than we do and because they only live three to six months , their weight and energy consumption equ@@ ate to about thir@@ ty billion people . 
that is , we are not too many , we are too stupid , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
and where you can see how far we are from what we really wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are that we are even on earth , you can see that , for example , offen@@ bac@@ h has a program until tw@@ ent@@ y fort@@ y you are climate neu@@ tra@@ l here , ye@@ s@@ ? 
they can only be carbon neu@@ tra@@ l if they do not exist , ye@@ s@@ ? 
the only chance . 
have you ever seen a climate neu@@ tra@@ l tre@@ e@@ ? 
yes ? 
a sing@@ le@@ ? 
that is , all our intelligence means we want to be more stupid than trees , ye@@ s@@ ? 
yes ? 
no tree is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l . 
not to lu@@ ck , ye@@ s@@ ? 
there is no over@@ population problem with trees . 
there are still six hundred billion trees in the ama@@ zon alone . 
have you ever heard of over@@ -@@ population problems of tre@@ es@@ ? 
that is , all our intelligence means we want to be more stupid than trees . 
and where you see , even with something like de@@ meter , the stri@@ ct@@ est organic far@@ ming , does not allow our own meta@@ bol@@ ites to dec@@ line . 
each year , we lose three million ton@@ nes of phosp@@ hor@@ us , which would really have to go back in cy@@ cles . 
and we are too many . 
alone about it . 
that is , we feel so gui@@ l@@ ty on the earth that we say . there is no organic far@@ ming , no bio@@ land , no %nature-et-progrès and as they all call , that allow our own exc@@ re@@ ments to go back . 
is not that sa@@ d@@ ? 
we are too many . 
it certainly makes sense to be less har@@ m@@ ful in terms of oil consumption . 
but where are we use@@ ful@@ ? 
we try to minim@@ ize our ec@@ ological foot@@ print , but it &apos;s about having a big foot@@ print that &apos;s useful . 
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest is not being there , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
zero emissions , ye@@ s@@ ? 
they can only have zero emissions if they are not there . 
even if they sho@@ ot now , they would have emissions . 
so they can not solve it . 
we can do it differently . 
we can rec@@ over our nutri@@ ents . 
we do agriculture in brazil from where we rec@@ over the nutri@@ ents . 
we can directly recycl@@ e nutri@@ ents into agriculture in this way . 
we do this in china , for example , where we directly take the waste from it . 
in china , a po@@ t is still called hon@@ ey po@@ t , so to speak , ye@@ s@@ ? 
and in our western world we have always been too stupid to bring back our nutri@@ ents . 
that is , the whole history of western civilization is characteri@@ zed by the fact that the city has always taken but has never re@@ turned anything to the farmers . 
as a result , the cities had to grow more and more because the farmers went to the cities and the cities had to fe@@ tch their nutri@@ ents ever further away . 
that &apos;s why all the western emp@@ ires have always expan@@ ded until they have not made the infrastructure and then they have imp@@ lo@@ ded . 
yes ? 
it was different in china . 
civilization has been ac@@ compli@@ shed without inter@@ ruption for over five thousand years , because one has always been able to bring back the nutri@@ ents . 
even today , when they are invited to eat in china , after dinner they are expected to stay until they go to the rest@@ room . 
because it is un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents with you . 
you have them too you invited them to eat , not to nutri@@ ent the@@ ft . 
in other words , you can see on the internet how to rec@@ over the nutri@@ ents . 
the really nice thing about doing that , that is far@@ ming , producing bio@@ gas , on a he@@ ct@@ are of land with five thousand in@@ habit@@ ants in fa@@ vel@@ as , can make a far@@ mer ear@@ n about fif@@ te@@ en hundred dollars and main@@ tain the plant , chic@@ ken@@ s and pig@@ s bre@@ ed and duc@@ ks and vege@@ tables and fish . 
and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the fa@@ vel@@ as goes down by over nin@@ et@@ y percent . 
so we do not have to control people to be as bad as possible . 
we can help you to be good . 
of course , this is high-@@ tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves . 
the by@@ -@@ product is clean water . 
and they are designed by the design that a far@@ mer can easily manage . 
that is , the crime rates go back . 
and none of these facili@@ ties , we have now built over a hundred and fif@@ ty in the last tw@@ ent@@ y years , none of these facili@@ ties has ever been sa@@ bot@@ ag@@ ed . 
they could easily throw in a gall@@ on of old oil and then the plant would be ru@@ ined for years . 
does not take place . 
that is , we do not have to control people to be as bad as possible . 
we can help you to be good . 
that is , we have to get phosp@@ hor@@ us back . 
and by the way , if you want to do something from this , write down yourself , in germany the most su@@ it@@ able of all se@@ wa@@ ge treatment plants is in frank@@ fur@@ t . 
unfortunately they are not in offen@@ bac@@ h , but maybe they can help the frank@@ fur@@ ters a bit . 
because the frank@@ fur@@ t plant could best rec@@ over the phosp@@ hor@@ us . 
and he has to go back . 
we see that phosp@@ ho@@ r is really critical . 
and we see that it succe@@ ed@@ s . 
we have now spent more than three years in hol@@ land . 
the du@@ tch government has dec@@ lar@@ ed that they will be the first country in the world to rec@@ over phosp@@ hor@@ us . 
but we need that in total . 
you understand , there are two countries that control almost se@@ vent@@ y percent of phosp@@ hor@@ us worldwide . 
there the op@@ e@@ c is a bunch of or@@ ph@@ an boys . 
these are tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ six countries controll@@ ing fort@@ y percent of oil stock@@ s . 
and we will be able to replace the oil with other energy sources . 
but you will not be able to replace the phosp@@ hor@@ us . 
so it &apos;s not about making the exist@@ ing one a little less bad , it &apos;s about doing something right . 
and above all , first of all , ask yourself what &apos;s the right one . 
that is , it &apos;s about effec@@ tiv@@ eness , not efficiency . 
in hol@@ land , of course , this is easier , because in hol@@ land , the country is built on flo@@ wers . 
yes ? 
imagine if , for example , your wife is sad when she gets ang@@ ry , and you come with fif@@ ty ro@@ ses . 
completely in@@ efficient . 
but completely effective , ye@@ s@@ ? 
or take a li@@ p@@ stick . 
a woman in germany e@@ ats about six point three kil@@ ogra@@ ms during her life . 
with it . 
scienti@@ fically , that &apos;s not exactly accu@@ rate , because we do not know how much is ki@@ ss@@ ed away . 
but a li@@ p@@ stick , even with this ligh@@ ting , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but quite effective , ye@@ s@@ ? 
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient . 
therefore not resource efficiency , but effec@@ tiv@@ eness . 
to ask , what is the right one@@ ? 
not to burn the se@@ wa@@ ge sl@@ u@@ dge a little better and de@@ posi@@ t it with it and lose all the materials for recycl@@ ing in the inci@@ ner@@ ator , but first of all ask how do you close cy@@ cle@@ s@@ ? 
imagine mo@@ zar@@ t effici@@ ently . 
yes ? 
if i invi@@ te you to dinner and say , yes , there is a tab@@ let with offen@@ bac@@ h taste and a glass of water . 
wonderful , &apos;@@ ; ne@@ ? 
that &apos;s efficient . 
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient . 
if you fall in love with someone , effici@@ ent@@ ? 
yes ? 
that is , everything that coun@@ ts in life is gon@@ e@@ ; s not about saving , avo@@ i@@ ding , redu@@ cing . 
the whole environmental discussion . 
we tell the people , oh yes , you have no environmental awareness in the south . 
no , thro@@ wing away is just right , ye@@ s@@ ? 
at every point where you throw away , from , yes , you create opportunities for life again . 
but the wrong things . 
if you throw away the wrong things , you have a gar@@ bag@@ e problem . 
in how we think from the north . 
every foot@@ print is dis@@ advan@@ tag@@ e@@ ous there . 
when you walk , yes , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys the floor . 
because the soil will die off the mo@@ o@@ se and the wind and the water will was@@ h the soil away . 
but if you are in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means that the water sta@@ ys in the me@@ a@@ dow longer . 
so , it &apos;s about creating a big foot@@ print that becomes a we@@ t@@ land . 
not deb@@ t management . 
we say sustain@@ ability in germany . 
yes ? 
but if i ask her , how are you@@ ? do you like that with your wi@@ fe@@ ? 
what do you say the@@ n@@ ? 
sustainable . 
then i say , he@@ art@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences , ye@@ s@@ ? 
that &apos;s just the minim@@ um . 
so do not save , do without , avoid . 
every waste is nutri@@ ent . 
and it &apos;s a pleasure to see them in it@@ al@@ y as people in high spir@@ its do@@ ; ne col@@ a@@ dose out of the car , in addition . 
because you know , this is a pleas@@ ur@@ able process . 
it is &apos;@@ ; ne form of re@@ vier behavior , ye@@ s@@ ? 
they can show i was there . 
but with the right design , please . 
for example , we have developed an ic@@ e-@@ crea@@ m pac@@ ka@@ ging that is at room temperature &apos;@@ ; ne flu@@ id . 
they can throw them away , where they go and stand . 
in two hours it will break down everywhere . 
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants , so that by thro@@ wing away they contribu@@ te to the diversity of species . 
that is , we are useful , no less har@@ m@@ ful . 
so there are two cy@@ cles . 
not everything should of course be comp@@ ost@@ able . 
a tv or a wash@@ ing machine , they only use , they do not consum@@ e . 
only the things that wear out , such as sho@@ e sol@@ es , such as bra@@ ke pa@@ ds , like car t@@ ires , must be such that they go into biological systems . 
the things that are only used go into technical systems . 
but today we only talk about the biological systems . 
yes ? 
for example the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , ye@@ s@@ ? 
quite direct adverti@@ sing , not for pu@@ ma per se , but for helping this company to make these products successful . 
because we do not we do not make things more free of . 
yes ? 
so , if i invi@@ te you to eat and say it &apos;s chic@@ k-@@ free , it will not help them . 
no , we determin@@ e what &apos;s in it . 
positive . 
so not like det@@ o@@ x . 
not po@@ iso@@ no@@ us in it . 
but everything that is in it is useful . 
these are the first shoes with which you can lay down the ca@@ val@@ ier start at the pe@@ dest@@ ri@@ an light and the ru@@ b@@ ber can go into biological circu@@ its , ye@@ s@@ ? 
all of it is comp@@ ost@@ able of it . 
and if we succe@@ ed , of course , we will succe@@ ed for adi@@ das , for ni@@ ke , for hen@@ nes and mau@@ ri@@ tz , and for the entire tex@@ tile industry . 
and that is half of the world &apos;s was@@ te@@ water problems caused by the tex@@ tile industry . 
that &apos;s why they help with that , ask the people . 
hey , cou@@ gar , are you really seri@@ ous@@ ? 
because they have already twice changed the cha@@ ir@@ man of the board . 
and i &apos;m not so sure if they really stick to it . 
so , help me with it a bit . 
but it works . 
yes . 
that which has just been pres@@ ented . 
this works out . 
we can now do things like that , if they wear out , if they break , they can enter biological cy@@ cles . 
technical cy@@ cles are &apos;@@ ; it &apos;s the same . 
there is a direct re-@@ nam@@ ing system for this . 
this is the first ec@@ ological back@@ pack , in fact , made for going back into the cycle . 
also that , so in each store you can get the things back . 
if they come to that , ye@@ s@@ ? 
do you remember the di@@ aper aga@@ in@@ ? 
if at the moment is the gar@@ bag@@ e . 
everywhere these di@@ ap@@ ers are around , almost . 
in the countries where people come to money . 
in front of the land@@ fil@@ ls , but otherwise in the landscape , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
if we change the plastic so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water stor@@ age inside , that they can just go back to cell@@ u@@ los@@ ic , then you can plant one hundred and fif@@ ty trees with a baby in israel or tun@@ isi@@ a . 
yes ? 
but if you take this di@@ aper , cru@@ sh it , ster@@ ili@@ ze it , and take the po@@ w@@ der to plant trees . 
so the baby is carbon positive for the whole life , from the very beginning . 
so , we do not need to be clim@@ ate@@ -@@ neu@@ tra@@ l , we can be %climate-positive . 
it &apos;s about a bene@@ ficial po@@ op print , so to speak . 
yes , so to speak . 
yes ? 
we can do that . 
we can rein@@ vent everything again . 
i foun@@ ded an institute for this purpose . 
in the mean@@ time many people work there and they can all get involved . 
there is an extra club , %cradle-to-cradle-verein , where everyone can join . 
so no longer save , dis@@ pen@@ se , avoid , reduce , no deb@@ t management , but intelligent waste . 
does she make that curi@@ ous@@ ? 
thank you very much . 
the work of the interpre@@ ter . 
music as language . 
in the descri@@ ption to my speech it is written that i understand as an interpre@@ ter , me as a transl@@ ator , so in the english word meaning . 
interpre@@ ters are transl@@ ators of written music into so@@ unding music . 
that as a transl@@ ator not only word by word transl@@ ates the text into another language , but also has to understand the deeper meaning of the words and word context , so that it makes a meaning@@ ful transl@@ ation , knows anyone who has to do with foreign languages . 
transl@@ ating from ger@@ man into english can require more knowledge , especially when it comes to poetry or even poetry . 
but it is completely alien for the ama@@ teu@@ r what we musi@@ cians do with our musical language . 
as an interpre@@ ter of a piece of music , i initi@@ ally only have the written notes . 
you are sure that the com@@ pos@@ er wrote down in the notes exactly what he thought up . 
in fact , the notes are very vag@@ ue and in@@ accu@@ rate . 
these notes are about as accu@@ rate or in@@ accu@@ rate as a verb@@ al , al@@ bei@@ t very seem@@ ingly met@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous , descri@@ ption of a landscape . 
because in this verb@@ al landscape descri@@ ption , the frag@@ ran@@ ce of the flo@@ wers is not to smell , the degree of green only to guess , the mur@@ mu@@ r of the wind not to hear , not to feel . 
that is , the interpre@@ ter must transl@@ ate these in@@ accu@@ ra@@ cies of musical not@@ ation into another , audi@@ ble , conc@@ re@@ te , non@@ verb@@ al musical language . 
today i want to transl@@ ate what i otherwise interpre@@ t musi@@ cally , that is to say , into a verb@@ al language . 
in practice a transl@@ ation of the transl@@ ation . 
therefore , i pre@@ fer to do all this in ger@@ man , because if i had to transl@@ ate it into english again , it would be syn@@ ony@@ mous with transl@@ ation of the transl@@ ation of the transl@@ ation for me . 
so , the music works for me so much like the spo@@ ken language . 
the not@@ ated notes have the function of the letters of a fo@@ nt . 
so it is not enough to just learn to read the notes and to press the cor@@ respon@@ ding keys on the piano or the right spot on a viol@@ in string . 
those are just the letters that you have learned to paint . 
you only recognize the meaning of the letters when you can speak the language . 
consequ@@ ently , for the learning process of the music musical language is at least as long as for the spo@@ ken language . 
there are also gra@@ da@@ tions , whether you learn it for home use , just passi@@ ve under@@ stands or you can also speak activ@@ ely , to the musical na@@ tive speak@@ er . 
the artist &apos;s work begins in a similar way to that of a theater director . 
after you have cho@@ sen to play a piece , because you are enth@@ usi@@ ast@@ ic about it , you first search for back@@ gro@@ unds of the gene@@ sis of the com@@ position . 
one colle@@ cts information about the piece in the secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature . 
one read@@ s in the letters , di@@ aries , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts of the com@@ pos@@ er himself . 
one studies the works he com@@ posed before and after . 
one compar@@ es . 
reasons to write it . 
how and what did he feel@@ ? 
what were his living conditions like those of society and politi@@ c@@ s@@ ? 
i &apos;m interested in everything . 
one thinks one@@ self into this time by , for example , looking at con@@ temporary pictures or reading liter@@ ature . 
in time , as an interpre@@ ter , you also have a wealth of knowledge about the com@@ pos@@ er you play more often , and it is always easier for you to think and feel in it . 
the com@@ pos@@ er becomes more and more the friend with whom one lives together . 
his desire to write this piece is increasingly becoming my personal conc@@ ern for playing it . 
since the notes are anything but an exac@@ t record of the com@@ pos@@ er &apos;s conc@@ ern , but only a sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding , i now apply this frame@@ work to fill it again with meaning and meaning . 
i then say in my own words what might be written between this frame@@ work . 
i explain what these sounds could mean . 
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ er back then and what they could mean for him today . 
every sound , every phr@@ ase gets a meaning , because i feel it myself , because it spr@@ ings from my now personally lived . 
it must be in harmon@@ y for me here and now , otherwise i can not convince my audience that this is my conc@@ ern . 
it is always a very happy conc@@ ert , if i may have the experience , the piece that i have worked so long in advan@@ ce , how to experience new . 
how to experience a happy new day again and again , although always with the same ritu@@ als of life , getting up , having break@@ fast , going to work , so i experience the same piece again and again . 
i grew older one day , the seas@@ ons change , my pul@@ se slow@@ s down in the ev@@ ening than in the morning , in a conc@@ ert hall it takes more time for the sound to come back than at home . 
i percei@@ ve the brea@@ thing of the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously . 
all of this influ@@ ences me and all of this also influ@@ ences my experience with the com@@ position . 
it &apos;s also wonderful when i &apos;m on stage with a du@@ o partner and we have the same wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th . 
then the same thing happens as in a good , li@@ vely conversation . 
one brings in a new idea and immediately it is ans@@ wer@@ ed with a reaction . 
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen that we did not re@@ hea@@ r@@ se and what you can not re@@ hea@@ r@@ se . 
it &apos;s a lot of fun to make music that way , and you as the audience have experienced how the music communic@@ ates alive . 
so every conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert . 
i &apos;ll never play like this anymore . 
i can not play like i did in tw@@ ent@@ y years . 
i will have more experience of life than today and therefore i will have a lot more nu@@ ance@@ s of color , emotions and feelings in my range of music sounds than today . 
sure , i &apos;ll throw some po@@ ts out , but get new ones for that . 
have a nice conc@@ re@@ te example . 
it was on a piano course for music students with my belo@@ ved old teacher , professor j@@ ü@@ r@@ gen u@@ de , a well-@@ known bee@@ tho@@ ven speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pian@@ ist and lon@@ g@@ time professor of the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ schul@@ e here in stu@@ tt@@ gar@@ t . 
unfortunately , i was still too young , so he was already emer@@ it@@ us when i finally started to study . 
but i had the great fortun@@ e to get to know him very early , at the age of thir@@ te@@ en , and so i was on his cour@@ ses during my school days . 
i was se@@ vent@@ ee@@ n when i atten@@ ded one of his class@@ es again and played the last of the four ball@@ ads by cho@@ pi@@ n , a late work . 
he asked me what the introdu@@ ction of this ball@@ ad was for me . 
that is such a wor@@ n part . 
and in my you@@ th@@ ful@@ ness i said , expec@@ tation . 
he sm@@ ir@@ ked and said , so@@ ? 
that must be the age difference . 
because for me it means reme@@ m@@ bran@@ ce . 
he was already over six@@ ty . 
well , at se@@ vent@@ ee@@ n you have dreams , but no significant memor@@ ies . 
i play the track every few years today and it has always changed for me , although not a single note has changed . 
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again and again i read something new . 
an example from a completely different area . mon@@ et has paint@@ ed the water li@@ lies x times . 
it is always the same garden , but at different times of the day , with different light . 
he has transl@@ ated the water li@@ lies on various occasi@@ ons , as he has seen them , as they were acting on him at that moment . 
his personal impres@@ sions of water li@@ lies . 
the x-@@ times interpretation of a piece is compar@@ able to this one . 
mean@@ while , i am already older than cho@@ pi@@ n at thir@@ ty@@ -@@ two , when he wrote the piece . 
he lived only thir@@ ty@@ -@@ nine years . 
and it is important to me to keep looking at the notes , even if i think i can memor@@ ize them . 
to have a conversation with the com@@ pos@@ er . 
because the notes are the only connection directly to him . 
especially if he has already died . 
well , how do you start to speak the language of musi@@ c@@ ? 
i already said that it takes about as long as for the spo@@ ken language . 
often the music lessons are so that you learn to read the notes first . 
you practic@@ ally learn to read this first , before you speak only one word . 
one lear@@ ns to find the notes to the notes on the instrument . 
if all the finger@@ s move in time and cor@@ rec@@ tly as it is in the notes , then sounds come out that sound together like music . 
if this happens without er@@ ror , the student gets the next difficult piece . 
interpretation is bar@@ ely spo@@ ken in the beginn@@ ers class . 
well , then there is pres@@ to in front , that &apos;s a quick piece . 
len@@ to , slowly . 
lou@@ d and quie@@ t , f and b , et ce@@ ter@@ a . 
most of you know that . 
but even if you put these details into practice , it still rema@@ ins something technical . 
and still it is not an interpretation . 
i wonder . 
i am surprised that one often for@@ gets something element@@ ary . 
nam@@ ely , that in order to make music on the instrument , one &apos;s own musical do and feel should already exist before . 
nam@@ ely the sing@@ ing . 
a child who did not learn to sing , because the parents did not show it , will not do it by itself . 
it &apos;s like learning to speak . 
it is necessary to have your own experiences and idea of ​​the music in order to make it sound through another possibility , ie via an instrument . 
people who have never sung have never immediately felt with their own body what it is like to make a sound . 
to shape a phr@@ ase with your own breath . 
the musical instrument is the exten@@ sion of our body . 
our vo@@ cal cor@@ ds to sing , our hands and feet to dance . 
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the piano are the continu@@ ation of my finger@@ s . 
the mel@@ od@@ y ari@@ ses from the song and the rhyth@@ m from the dance . 
the const@@ ant spr@@ in@@ kl@@ ing with music today is not conduc@@ i@@ ve to it . 
you do not need to make music yourself when it gets bor@@ ing . 
no need to whi@@ st@@ le or sing a song . 
each of your own music is fl@@ atten@@ ed , if you are constantly so@@ unded from the outside with music . 
sure , there are some of them who say yes , but what do you do if i can not sing@@ ? 
i ask , can not they sing , a , because they believe that they can not sing@@ ? 
or b , because they have not learned to sing@@ ? 
it is not too late to start with both of them to find out if they can not , or to learn how to proper@@ ly use those little mus@@ cles that set the vo@@ cal cor@@ ds . 
you can train that . 
or c , because they have been cer@@ ti@@ fied to be un@@ fit . 
i ask , how profession@@ ally compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ si@@ s@@ ? 
have you already got a second or third opini@@ on , as you say it ni@@ cel@@ y no@@ wa@@ da@@ y@@ s@@ ? 
or d , they just do not like music and therefore do not want to have anything to do with it either . 
but what i would reg@@ re@@ t then , because music is a nice , communic@@ ative thing . 
but maybe you can change it too . 
well , so you see , in any case no one must be a hop@@ eless can@@ di@@ date . 
but please do not say , i understand nothing of classi@@ cal music . 
i can not say if it &apos;s good or bad . 
i answer that , but sur@@ ely you can tell if you like it or not . 
because i do not believe , someone says it , i do not know if &apos;@@ ; i like it because i can not coo@@ k . 
so , they do not give up eating just because they can not coo@@ k . 
so you do not have to do without classi@@ cal music because you do not play any instrument . 
listen care@@ fully and tell them if they like it or not . 
if the music is too pe@@ pp@@ ery or too swe@@ et for you . 
say what they feel . 
over time , they also get cla@@ ims and want to have a little more spi@@ ces in them or taste even sub@@ tle differences . 
why do i demand from my audience that it also activ@@ ely listen@@ s@@ ? 
because the music is a language and a language is there to communicate . 
a work of art that you never look at has no power to work . 
the food that was lo@@ v@@ ingly coo@@ ked by a coo@@ k or a coo@@ k must be e@@ aten and not just looked at or reci@@ pes ex@@ changed . 
so please listen when a music is playing . 
she is not just a nice noise wal@@ l@@ paper . 
if a child grow@@ s up in an environment where the adult is activ@@ ely playing music or at least activ@@ ely listening to music , then it &apos;s easy for a music teacher to ask what color is your flo@@ wer@@ ? 
can you play it in blue no@@ w@@ ? 
and the child plays , after a com@@ memor@@ ative break , instead of a red now a blue flo@@ wer instead . 
and this sounds completely different than before . 
that was the very first beginning of his own musical expression . 
so the first step to an interpretation . 
and what happens if you play a piece today that was origin@@ ally written a hundred , two hundred , or even three hundred years ag@@ o@@ ? 
mean@@ while , the instru@@ ments have evolved . 
at the time of bac@@ h there was no piano as an instrument . 
it just was not invented . 
i think that the bac@@ h would have been thri@@ ll@@ ed if he had had the ton@@ al possibilities of today &apos;s modern pian@@ os . 
today i can make the sound ideas that the bro@@ ok had on the modern wing sound like a bar@@ o@@ que har@@ p@@ sich@@ ord can not . 
bee@@ tho@@ ven also knows that he heard more than he had become dea@@ f already . 
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is capable of playing everything that an orche@@ str@@ a back then re@@ je@@ cted as un@@ play@@ able . 
that &apos;s why the com@@ pos@@ ers depen@@ d on us interpre@@ ters who rein@@ vent the pieces . 
so that they become audi@@ ble , what they thought up only in the spirit . 
and also what they would think in spirit today . 
or what i imagine today because of what they might have thought . 
thank you very much . 
do you know what is en@@ v@@ y@@ ? 
have you ever been je@@ alo@@ us@@ ? 
and how did that feel@@ ? 
shi@@ t . 
i have a friend who dri@@ ves a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i . 
when i come then , with my little v pe@@ sel and me next to it , this feeling comes up . 
something is sho@@ ot@@ ing through my head . 
i say , ul@@ f , why do you need it@@ ? n big car@@ ? 
that los@@ es half of its value in the first year . 
and anyway , you work much less than me . 
why do i have to do so &apos;@@ ; n afford a small car@@ ? 
and then i remember immediately , that &apos;s un@@ fair . 
it is against justice . 
and as i say the word justice , this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling is gone . 
our organis@@ m has invented a great way to make such un@@ pleas@@ ant feelings like en@@ vy disappe@@ ar . 
you can also try that with words like reven@@ ge or profit or something like that . 
today , with this mechanis@@ m , i want to explain something to you or bring you closer to something that you are probably un@@ consci@@ ously familiar with . 
the mechanis@@ m comes from the lie . 
but do not think about the lie that you may have heard when people say that no one has the inten@@ tion of building a wall . 
and then sto@@ nes pil@@ e up so he blocks their sight . 
on such a lie , they see that the li@@ ar himself does not believe what he says . 
it is also easy to check that he has completely different ideas . 
he is only dec@@ ei@@ ving them and not himself . 
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about has to do with fo@@ ol@@ ing yourself . 
they need this lie to be a life lie , to main@@ tain a self-@@ de@@ ception . 
they can less easily , yes , check or even bring to collapse . 
you need time . 
from this time speak@@ s an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that you may know . 
the span@@ ish paint@@ er pa@@ bl@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once portra@@ yed a woman . 
this woman then comp@@ la@@ ined that the portra@@ it would not look like her at all . 
pic@@ as@@ so answers , just wait . 
it becomes more and more like them . 
at this point and when they lau@@ gh , they realize how important this lie is and how much time they need to learn something that artists can tell us very well . 
because artists have a dist@@ ur@@ bed relationship to lying . 
the artist tells you something , and especially this lady , what she does not see when she just looks in the mirror . 
in such a portra@@ it , the artist tells them something they will only become familiar with when they look at this art@@ work again and again . 
then this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling disappe@@ ars , it might not look like it and it becomes more and more like it . 
here you have this mechanis@@ m with which we can use the lie as a great invention to stabili@@ ze our living conditions . 
and not only in art , but also in fol@@ k tal@@ es , in my@@ th@@ ology , in stories , it re@@ appe@@ ars . 
you may know this idea from the lady , who looked every morning in the mirror and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ ? 
one day this mirror says , yes , there is a ni@@ cer one . 
behind the seven mountains and so on . 
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty from this true information , even the mirror can not lie , spr@@ ings from this true information . 
but we should just get used to the fact that you can not tell a woman that there is a ni@@ cer place somewhere else . 
here it is necessary to rei@@ ter@@ ate what we understand by politi@@ cally cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness . 
at this point we need this lie , which kee@@ ps us dec@@ ei@@ ved , without which we can not go on living . 
we have such great lies not only in art , fol@@ k-@@ tale liter@@ ature , but also in science . 
and there is this story from the wife of the bi@@ shop of wor@@ che@@ ster . 
she heard of this book of charles darwin , the gene@@ sis of the species and the des@@ cent of man . 
that man should des@@ cen@@ d from the mon@@ key and , yes , there would at least be a common ance@@ sto@@ r between humans and mon@@ keys . 
and then she ran and ran to her husband and said that &apos;s not true what charles wri@@ tes . 
man should have des@@ cen@@ ded from the mon@@ key or have a common ance@@ sto@@ r . 
no no th@@ ats wrong . 
and if it is true , then we must prevent people from knowing it . 
why do we have to prevent people from knowing anything if it is tru@@ e@@ ? 
because we can not live without this life lie . 
because we have this self-@@ de@@ ception , that feeling of being great , of the highest beings , not of such a nature , of something as un@@ predi@@ ct@@ able as an organis@@ m that still exists , compar@@ able to a stone and other things , that is unbe@@ arab@@ le for us , 
so , we can not stand these things . 
we must prevent people from ga@@ ining knowledge of things , especially when they are true . 
so that you can see how slowly this mechanis@@ m dis@@ sol@@ ves and how the tra@@ ces it leaves behind , which lead to something other than this great picture of ourselves , i want to bring you another story closer . 
a beautiful story , i mean . 
my wife told me . 
she came from school one day , she is a teacher , and she told me about a student . 
an autis@@ tic student . 
she especially lik@@ es him because he has a passion for sin@@ cer@@ ity . 
and she asked him , what are your ho@@ b@@ bie@@ s@@ ? 
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department . 
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ techni@@ c things . 
yes , they already feel it when they are che@@ er@@ ful in this place . something is wrong here . 
i &apos;ve told my wife whenever a human in a moral justi@@ fication uses that word because we should try to replace it with the word though . 
do this once and then you will learn the sentence . 
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ techni@@ c things . 
you feel that is the real truth behind the information . 
such a little boy , who does not care about the fire extin@@ gu@@ ishing . 
he is interested in fir@@ ing . 
but there are no clu@@ bs that we can look for , where to learn how to make fire . 
there is only the second best , just the fire department . 
he sign@@ ed up . 
and , mor@@ e@@ over , one does not tell his teacher that one lik@@ es to lay fire@@ s somewhere and is happy when the fire later bla@@ zes . 
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we are responsible for elimin@@ ating the danger@@ s that others can only do if they set fire to it . 
here you have this little mechanis@@ m . 
this refer@@ ence to the fact that in the inner@@ most of the boy already knew that he is actually related to the fire , but that he can not say that out lou@@ d . 
here you have this cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious , which starts immediately without you being able to do anything about it , and the things that you know they look very different , designed to make them much better for you and others can sound . 
in that case , those words are simply created that we use again and again in the language of politi@@ cally cor@@ rect speech . 
actually , we know that something else is the case . 
but we know that when we say that , social conditions are very sensi@@ tively dist@@ ur@@ bed . 
we can not just do that . 
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to work . 
i would now like to explain to you what we found out in my institute . 
according to which logi@@ c this del@@ usi@@ on , this self-@@ del@@ usi@@ on , the read@@ iness to spread to the outside a reality other than that of which we already know in the un@@ conscious that it is val@@ id . 
i will show you two , maybe three examples . 
the first example assu@@ mes what many of them know and appreci@@ ate some of them , very few do not need at all . 
i mean the sou@@ l . 
what is the sou@@ l@@ ? 
the sou@@ l is something spiritu@@ al , say lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z . 
it is something that does not stop from material , material nature . 
and if you have people who are convinced that you have a sou@@ l , or you can say that they believe that they have been brought to life by the sou@@ l , then they imagine it as when if the sou@@ l were such a spiritu@@ al frame over them , not of matter , they themselves only of fle@@ sh and blood , something sto@@ ny , so to speak , boun@@ d to the earth , transi@@ ent , deca@@ y@@ able , un@@ important , even dead . 
and from this sou@@ l they now think that somehow in this clou@@ dy nature , in this air@@ y nature , anim@@ a , it is said in lat@@ in , the air of life , is present . 
and when this air then po@@ urs over man , then he is filled with dig@@ nity , with spirit , with nature , which can only live , even with sou@@ l . 
and then he can run away . 
that &apos;s the way the sou@@ l works . 
so it should be add@@ ed from the outside to the people . 
we should therefore percei@@ ve it as something that should necessarily be present for our lives . 
and if you have that condition in mind , then you understand the logi@@ c with which we experience this happiness , through a lie to improve our world . 
because now you can apply a sentence of three . 
you still know tri@@ ple@@ ts from school . 
this is now a tri@@ ad that descri@@ bes a logi@@ c . 
by the way , this is the hard@@ est part in my pres@@ entation . 
here you need some logi@@ c , but also the will@@ ing@@ ness to lie . 
nam@@ ely to lie so that you can simply mis@@ use this logi@@ c . 
this sentence con@@ tains three sent@@ ences . 
the first sentence read@@ s , kla@@ us cla@@ ims that there is no sou@@ l . 
the second sentence is that if he is right , then he has no sou@@ l . 
now there is a third sentence . 
i have high@@ ligh@@ ted it here . 
a third sentence that immediately turns up in people who have a strong sense of a sou@@ l . 
those who say that he has no sou@@ l are dead and can not asse@@ rt anything . 
and here they feel &apos;@@ ; it &apos;s fine . 
here is this logi@@ c expres@@ sed in this , yes , in this dec@@ ep@@ tive speech . 
they see it immediately . 
the first two sent@@ ences are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect . 
i can asse@@ rt everything . 
the logi@@ c makes no stat@@ ements about the reality . 
i can say that the chan@@ cell@@ or is a man . 
and if i &apos;m right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is a man . 
if i &apos;m not right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is not a man . 
the logi@@ c does not say what is true . 
i can asse@@ rt everything . 
but it is cru@@ cial , if i am right , then it appli@@ es . 
so when kla@@ us says there is no sou@@ l . 
secon@@ dly , if he is right , then he has no sou@@ l . 
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect . 
and now our dec@@ ep@@ tive consciousness immediately sen@@ ses that you can make something out of it . 
it attac@@ hes a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences , and does so as if the opposite of the first sentence were already pro@@ ved and pre@@ supposed . 
because actually we would have to prove , if there is a sou@@ l or not . 
but with this logi@@ c that simply uses two sent@@ ences to be logi@@ cally cor@@ rect , and add@@ s a third that looks like it has something to do with it , we can save our life@@ -@@ lie . 
well , we pre@@ tend that it is impossible to live without a sou@@ l . 
and we are very happy about it . 
we can continue these things with different examples . 
in the present , for example , we have a very modern example that kee@@ ps fil@@ ling the daily pa@@ pers . 
to do this , you must have another philosoph@@ ical theme , a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al philosoph@@ y . 
this has to do with the fact that we go back to the four@@ teen@@ th century . 
there was a scho@@ la@@ r named jo@@ han@@ nes bur@@ i@@ dan@@ us and after that is named the bur@@ i@@ dan don@@ key . 
the bur@@ i@@ dan don@@ key is a don@@ key made of pur@@ e nature . 
he does not have that sou@@ l . 
that is such a natural thing . 
and if you place it exactly in the middle between two equal ha@@ y ba@@ ys , then it star@@ ves . 
because he does not know to which ha@@ y@@ stac@@ k he should go first . 
so he is right in the middle . 
that &apos;s how the natural things are pres@@ ented . 
equal power@@ s with opposite sign@@ s of conflict dis@@ solve each other . 
nothing happens at all . 
only if you then bring another example , that is , if you make a ha@@ y@@ stac@@ k bigger immediately , then he needs no reason and nothing at all . 
auto@@ matically he run@@ s to the right thought . 
so if you have the idea that you are somehow driven in nature , determin@@ ed by the larger clu@@ sters that attra@@ ct you right away , then you also quickly feel that there has to be something like a free will . 
and while we are already here in frank@@ fur@@ t am main , then i remember the ma@@ x plan@@ ck institute for brain research . 
there is a scho@@ la@@ r , that is wol@@ f sing@@ er , and from him one sometimes says , wol@@ f sing@@ er cla@@ ims , there is no freedom of choice . 
now we can form the second sentence again and can say that if wol@@ f sing@@ er is right , then he has no free will . 
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect . 
and what we can read almost daily in the daily newspaper , you will find in this third sentence . 
who looks like he who has no free will , can not be dra@@ wn for his actions and alle@@ ga@@ tions to be held responsible and he is therefore in@@ compe@@ tent . 
they have it again , too . 
actually , one would first have to prove whether there is such a thing as freedom of choice . 
but the logi@@ c of de@@ ception allows us to pre@@ tend that the first sentence is wrong from the out@@ set , as if , of course , one had to accept the opposite without any pro@@ of . 
and now , if you yourself want to do something , if you want to test something yourself and , above all , if you want to make people happy , you can simply practice this coura@@ ge to lie . 
for example , if you meet a person whom you can then say , there are no predi@@ ctors . 
and please do not use the ger@@ man word for predi@@ ctor , that is prop@@ he@@ t . 
they may not call that , that would be a bit politi@@ cally in@@ cor@@ rect again . 
say , there are no predi@@ ctors . 
immediately you will find out about someone who naturally has such predi@@ ctors , you can not prove that . 
and you already have a problem . 
because while you are bus@@ y making it clear that you can not prove that there are no predi@@ ctors , the man is quite happy . 
he is very happy because he has dec@@ ei@@ ved her . 
because he led her to a track where he does not stop himself . 
because actually this person is not interested in pro@@ ving . 
he is only interested in keeping himself free from the need to prove that there are predi@@ ctors . 
so , in the way of shif@@ ting the bur@@ den of pro@@ of , you experience the grand@@ eu@@ r of the lie . 
and once you have such a chance to feel this movement with other people , they will do it , because they will make others happy if they do not remin@@ d you of their self-@@ lying . 
thank you for your attention . 
yes , good day . 
i have allowed myself i asked li@@ ll@@ y if i may mention her . 
she is one of the organi@@ zer@@ s of this great event and has asked me if i want to give a speech here and share my ideas . 
i have to say hon@@ est@@ ly , you got it , it was difficult at first to talk about my idea . 
and maybe i would like to introduce my island project , that i try to introduce you . 
but of course it is the sum of quite , very many ideas . 
i probably bel@@ ong , are the two nice girls still there , i probably bel@@ ong to the generation that has provi@@ ded for this bad ec@@ o image , because i have already be@@ gun nin@@ et@@ ee@@ n se@@ vent@@ y-@@ nine studying mechan@@ ical engineering in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he , technical college , today it means , i believe ki@@ t . 
and i have &apos;@@ ; then in the middle of the eig@@ ht@@ ies i moved to ber@@ lin because i wanted to do rene@@ wa@@ ble energi@@ es and gave it up . s in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he not . 
there was &apos;@@ ; s the nuclear research facili@@ ty le@@ op@@ ol@@ d@@ sha@@ fen . 
at that time they were all k@@ f@@ a , also the j@@ ü@@ lich was called k@@ f@@ a . 
the hot project spon@@ sor@@ s today . 
because a good engineer has built either great cars or nuclear power plants . 
but something stupid like &apos;@@ ; n solar pen@@ dul@@ um , from which somehow a hundred wat@@ ts come out of the square meter , that was a to@@ y . 
and in ber@@ lin there was a crazy engineering collective . 
i am gra@@ te@@ ful to the pre@@ mi@@ um kol@@ a-@@ mensch that he re@@ hab@@ ili@@ tat@@ ed the word again , because after the fall of the wall you could not use the word anymore because everything left was bad . 
however , that was not the case in the eig@@ ht@@ ies . 
there it was just that there were self-@@ managed alternative far@@ ms and one of them was just in kre@@ u@@ z@@ berg im mehr@@ ing@@ ho@@ f , where they su@@ spec@@ ted the evil . 
place of terror@@ ism , but that was called wus@@ el@@ tro@@ nik and made wind and solar energy and i started there in the middle of the eig@@ ht@@ ies . 
and yes , much of what was said today tou@@ ches me a lot , because there were many , many beautiful stat@@ ements that i have also lived through . 
i worked ele@@ ven years in the collective , that was gras@@ s@@ roots democratic . 
we were tw@@ ent@@ y people . 
if one said no , that was the ve@@ to principle , that completely ru@@ ined one . i &apos;ve been wonder@@ ing for ten years if i could really waste my great engineering studies on a mor@@ onic thing , because all of my dad &apos;s colleagues always talked him out , you thre@@ w the money out the window at your kid &apos;s . 
it dea@@ ls with non@@ sense . 
and that was really very , very bit@@ ter and you come in so &apos;@@ ; ne phase into it , just appe@@ ared a picture on hold , where i wonder@@ ed after ten years , a thousand d-@@ mark that were still then , basic wa@@ ges , unit wa@@ ge in the collective of course , whether that really should be the great . 
and i have &apos;@@ ; s then held up to nin@@ et@@ y-@@ six and then together with friends i co-@@ foun@@ ded the company sol@@ on , which together with the spin@@ -@@ off q@@ -@@ cells became one of the largest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world . 
a huge success story , but of course we also have the problem of a growing company and then we have two thousand six , a small group , decided that we start small again and go back and de@@ dic@@ ate ourselves to the next top@@ ic of the future and that means of my vie@@ ws and our view it &apos;s crazy again , it starts again with people saying , what &apos;s the non@@ sense , that &apos;s not possible , we &apos;re talking about saving . 
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce to you now . 
and the ti@@ tle of the lec@@ ture was , yes , how to get a hundred percent rene@@ wa@@ ble . 
and we have just started with a relatively simpl@@ e-@@ crazy story to ask , where could one use a memory sensi@@ bly to@@ da@@ y@@ ? 
on this island , this is the island gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ zo@@ re@@ s . 
yes , that &apos;s the data . 
there live four and a half thousand people . 
today they have a rene@@ wa@@ ble energy share of fif@@ te@@ en percent . 
and the question is , why do not you have it any@@ mor@@ e@@ ? 
that simply is not technologi@@ cally possible . 
if you add more wind power to each other , the system will start to fail . 
i always tell the politicians when they visit our plant in %berlin-adlershof . 
they always say , wh@@ y@@ ? 
we already have tw@@ ent@@ y percent in germany . 
can not be a problem . 
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is physi@@ cally the european one . 
if we had tw@@ ent@@ y percent in europe , then we would already have the same problems that the people on this island have there . 
the question was simple , expec@@ ts that was two thousand , 2006 , the first cont@@ acts with the island started , let &apos;s just think . 
how big would it really take to have a battery so that you could bring an island to tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , fort@@ y , fif@@ ty , maybe even se@@ vent@@ y percent rene@@ wa@@ ble . 
and yes , i &apos;ll go on a slide again . 
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world . 
inci@@ dent@@ ally , about one hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of electric power are built on a dies@@ el basis every year around the world . 
that &apos;s equivalent to the out@@ put of a hundred nuclear power plants , because that &apos;s particularly fast everywhere . 
the hunger for energy in the world that takes place is extin@@ gui@@ shed with dies@@ el because there is no need for auth@@ ori@@ zation . 
going fast . 
you put it that way &apos;@@ ; ne box down . 
and then it usually looks like this . 
three of the diesel@@ s are always in the lead , two are always being ser@@ vic@@ ed . 
yes , that &apos;s what the down@@ sta@@ irs is just the last . 
we also got very accu@@ rate data . 
and the wind tur@@ bine or the solar system or whatever it is , is usually a back@@ -up system or a system that can only feed in small quanti@@ ties here . 
our goal was to just say , ok@@ a@@ y@@ , 
the dies@@ el becomes back@@ -up and the wind and sun serve the load so that they can re@@ produce the larger share . 
and if you want to go over tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty percent rene@@ wa@@ ble energy , ie energy per year , not the power at the moment , then you have to turn off the dies@@ el . 
in other words , at the moment they have to ens@@ ure that the rene@@ wa@@ ble energi@@ es can , as it were , take over the entire network . 
of course , they can only do that if they are managed here in any way . 
nobody in the world has done that yet . 
which gives &apos;@@ ; s in a small style , so you can also operate your sha@@ ver in the car via a small inv@@ er@@ ter . 
people always ask me , what are you doing in ad@@ ler@@ sho@@ f@@ ? 
that &apos;s al@@ right . 
but if you want to connect several of these inv@@ er@@ ters together and they are supposed to build a network , then that will be extremely complicated . 
and our goal was just that , we wanted to get se@@ vent@@ y to nin@@ et@@ y percent rene@@ wa@@ ble and then this rest , the last rest , the last ten , tw@@ ent@@ y percent rene@@ wa@@ ble with , will become very , very expensive and that will not work , that makes it from batter@@ ies . 
in any case , that will be an energy car@@ rier , which then , hydrogen , meth@@ an@@ e , power to gas will know you or sh , that &apos;s what it will be . 
you then have to go for a seas@@ onal store and balance win@@ ter-@@ summer and not just da@@ y-@@ night . 
we just wanted to know , what about a normal , normal electro@@ chemical battery . 
how far can you get there@@ ? 
and then did a lot of simul@@ ations . 
and have simul@@ ated wind and sun and load and came to the conclu@@ sion , a very exciting result that comes out at about fort@@ y-@@ four cents compared to the conven@@ tional system , which requires a mean electricity price of about fif@@ ty cents per kil@@ ow@@ att hour after tw@@ ent@@ y years . 
these were the very first calcul@@ ations six years ago . 
and then we said , ok@@ a@@ y@@ , 
is great , then we have a business model . 
we are che@@ aper than the dies@@ el system when the dies@@ el price ris@@ es five percent a year . 
and then we started negoti@@ ating with the insu@@ lan@@ s . 
what should be don@@ e@@ ? 
negoti@@ ated with invest@@ ors , i looked for new shar@@ e@@ hol@@ ders . 
we were only five people at that time to re@@ build one around society . 
and here again the pres@@ entation . 
the brown is , so to speak , the conven@@ tional system , the green is our system . 
that our system also has a price increase , is because we still do tw@@ ent@@ y percent with dies@@ el and also not hit a price increase on the other things . 
and the power u@@ tili@@ ty , which the electricity company on the island , meant , we think that &apos;s great . 
we also want to support , but we do not believe you , that you can solve the technical problem . 
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in ber@@ lin , in which we can , so to speak , map the electrical conditions of the island on a scale of one to three . 
that is , we then first sou@@ ght to find the largest battery in the world . 
here she is . 
it comes naturally from asia , in that case from japan . 
and fun@@ ni@@ ly , it was developed in the se@@ venti@@ es by b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , today ab@@ b , and was then out@@ licen@@ sed to the japanese . 
you can see it is a very , very big battery . 
it has one me@@ ga@@ watt of power and can deliver that power for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery we got out of the simulation , so to speak . 
and then set them up . 
we also put one of these dies@@ el uni@@ ts in the same size as it stands in the hall , in order to actually have the complete dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall it now looks like that , there &apos;s the dies@@ el , here there is the big battery , here are the whole conver@@ ters , with which we simul@@ ate the net . 
over here , we simul@@ ate the entire trans@@ mission line system , the kilometer physics of the cab@@ les , so to speak , to map the vi@@ bra@@ tion behavior in the network . 
and here you can see the whole thing again . 
we can also connect two hundred kil@@ ow@@ att@@ s of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic to the grid . 
here we see it again here we see again the dies@@ el , here again the whole , individual gen@@ sets . 
and what we did , since the age of two thousand , the hall was finished , until today , two thousand and tw@@ el@@ ve , almost everything that was developed here between the individual system of electro@@ ni@@ cs and software , we have done . 
so we are not battery manufac@@ tur@@ ers , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the subject battery and the subject of network and everything in between . 
of course you have to communicate to the battery , you also have to be able to communicate to the net , and that is very complicated . 
the nice thing about the theme that you can basically take on this island today is anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing all the problems that we will get if we want to increase our share of rene@@ wa@@ ble . 
so this whole discussion , how is moving back and forth , energy turn , how to do that , on the island , for example , we have for tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five to thir@@ ty percent exc@@ ess energy , so we have to ad@@ just the wind and the sun . 
naturally , smar@@ t-@@ grid is the ide@@ al solution . 
so smar@@ t-@@ grid , a huge top@@ ic everywhere . 
we can start to integr@@ ate electro@@ mobili@@ ty on the island , ask around , can we manage the load . 
that is , if you &apos;re at se@@ vent@@ y percent rene@@ wa@@ ble , then you will not be able to do that without memory . 
one can by &apos;@@ ; n smar@@ t-@@ grid , one can by expan@@ ding the networks , yes , which one should do in any case , the share hear , but you will never be able to do without memory completely . 
and that is so &apos;@@ ; a little bit the message . 
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , just because you can see what problems you get . 
if we switch off the dies@@ el , then you just do not have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes a certain ine@@ r@@ ti@@ a in the network . 
and our european network of networks basically consi@@ sts only of ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of large power plants , where the waves are always the same all over europe . 
we look into this net , see the fif@@ ty@@ -@@ her@@ tz , and when it &apos;s nin@@ e-@@ fif@@ ty nine , we start opening a few val@@ ves , then a little more ste@@ am goes in , then we come up again . 
that &apos;s the system . 
and of course that is incredibly sl@@ ug@@ gi@@ sh . 
if they tea@@ r that down somewhere , then it takes &apos;@@ ; s &apos;@@ ; a while . 
the spin@@ ning reser@@ ve has at least ten seconds to keep the grid stable . 
and in time they can re@@ act differently again . 
if you no longer have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , then you have to replace it with power electro@@ ni@@ cs and %electrochemistry . 
and we can switch it out with this big battery two milli@@ seconds once . 
there you can already see what enormous speed opti@@ ons there are . 
and the message now is , we have to give up those ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses if we sort of set our goals tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y percent , tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , thir@@ ty percent and so on , if we ever want to achieve that 
then we have to reduce our mus@@ t-@@ run capacity in the network . 
mus@@ t-@@ run simply means that the power plant run@@ s along to keep the frequ@@ ency . 
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate at the moment , coal min@@ ing power plants , because we have no , or gas tur@@ bin@@ es , because that &apos;s not possible . 
and we just try to make it clear that you can reduce the capacity , the mus@@ t-@@ run capac@@ it@@ ies , by also bringing electro@@ chemical stor@@ age into the grid . 
fortunately , there are now a lot of studies . 
and for this purpose , people always come and look at our test stand on the , virtu@@ ally our island stand . 
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ e a piece of the future . 
and many of the discus@@ sions that i have had over the past six years have been similar to the discussion i have had on photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics over the last thir@@ ty years . 
is not , is non@@ sense , kinder@@ game , we have everything expected , never rec@@ kon@@ s . 
today , we have thir@@ ty gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics in germany . 
that is ex@@ emp@@ lar@@ y . 
and i &apos;m just assu@@ ming that over the next thir@@ ty years , we &apos;ll have the same capacity for electro@@ chemical stor@@ age around the world . 
quite simply , it will come . 
there will be a lot of resi@@ stance and quar@@ rel@@ s . 
the nice thing is that i have almost experienced in the last two years that the scientists are on my side . 
we have now received more than ten million pro@@ mo@@ tional projects , including &apos;@@ ; ne ten@@ -@@ me@@ ga@@ watt battery now to the ger@@ man network to cla@@ mp . 
this will take place next ap@@ ri@@ l . 
so from there you also notice that there is a change and only from this defen@@ sive at@@ titude to yes , to the idea , a hundred percent rene@@ wa@@ ble yes . 
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ wa@@ ble , then that &apos;s like a self-@@ suff@@ i@@ cient system . 
so far , discus@@ sions are always trying to make these insu@@ lan@@ s who are self-@@ suff@@ i@@ cient , who have their own small network , which has nothing to do with our associ@@ ation . 
the question is quite simple , if you are completely independent of any fossil or ur@@ ani@@ um energy car@@ rie@@ rs that are being dri@@ ll@@ ed out somewhere in the world and brought to you , then you are an island . 
then they only use what is left of the sun and wind , where they live . 
and that &apos;s kind of our vision of a reas@@ on@@ able energy supply and i &apos;m also gra@@ te@@ ful to %cradle-to-cradle for using solar energy . 
and that is what we do , and in that sense , as well as the lec@@ ture of pre@@ mi@@ um kol@@ a , that one can again be a collective and use solar energy , come here a little bit together . 
and yes , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a bit crazy and also have a vision . 
and you really have to stick with it pretty tough , but i think that &apos;s possible . 
many thanks . 
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , los angeles times colum@@ nis@@ t , one day walked the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music . 
she came from a man , an %african-american , symp@@ a@@ thetic , rou@@ gh , home@@ less , who played on a viol@@ in that had only two str@@ ings left . 
many of them will know the story , because steve &apos;s article later became a book that was film@@ ed , with robert down@@ ey jun@@ ior as steve lo@@ pe@@ z and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as nat@@ han@@ iel anth@@ ony a@@ yers , the contra@@ bas@@ si@@ st , who studied at the ju@@ ill@@ i@@ ard conser@@ vat@@ ory and its promis@@ ing tra@@ gi@@ cally ended early by his para@@ no@@ id schizophren@@ ia . 
nat@@ han@@ iel left ju@@ ill@@ i@@ ard , suff@@ ered a nervous break@@ down , and 30 years later he was home@@ less on the streets of ski@@ d row in the center of los angeles . 
i re@@ comm@@ end you all to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie , so that you not only understand the wonderful bon@@ d that has developed between these two men , but also how the music helped to make this connection and how it was ultimately the instrument . if this pu@@ n is allowed , helping to get nat@@ han@@ iel off the street . 
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall . 
he had just heard a performance of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth symp@@ hon@@ y and came back@@ stage to introduce himself to me . 
he spoke in a very che@@ er@@ ful and soci@@ able ton@@ e about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and hil@@ lar@@ y clin@@ ton and about how the do@@ d@@ gers would never make it into the base@@ ball world series . and all because of the tre@@ ach@@ ero@@ us pas@@ sage of the first viol@@ in in the last movement of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth symp@@ hon@@ y . 
we came to the top@@ ic of music . and a few days later i got an e-@@ mail stat@@ ing that nat@@ han@@ iel was interested in viol@@ in lessons for me . 
i must also mention that nat@@ han@@ iel re@@ fu@@ sed medical treatment because he had already been treated with electric sho@@ cks and with tho@@ ra@@ zin and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , a trau@@ ma that has pers@@ ecu@@ ted him all his life . 
as a result , he is now particularly vulnerable to these schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases . sometimes they are so bad and he disappe@@ ars for days , wander@@ ing the streets of ski@@ d row , always ex@@ posed to the hor@@ ror and tor@@ ture of his own mind . 
and that &apos;s how nat@@ han@@ iel was when we started our first lesson in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall . he had this mad fli@@ cker@@ ing in his eyes and seemed completely lost . 
he talked about invisible demon@@ s and smo@@ kes and about how someone wanted to po@@ ison him in his sleep . 
i was sc@@ ared , not because of me , but i was afraid that i might lose him , that he might sin@@ k into one of his states , and that i could destro@@ y his relationship with the viol@@ in when i began , via sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms di@@ da@@ ct@@ ic viol@@ in pe@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ y . 
so i just started to play . 
i played the first movement of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s viol@@ in conc@@ er@@ to . 
and as i played , it struc@@ k me that there was a complete change in nat@@ han@@ iel &apos;s eyes . 
it was as if he were under the influence of an invisible medicine , a chemical reaction whose cat@@ aly@@ st was my game . 
nat@@ han@@ iel &apos;s mani@@ c wra@@ th turned into understanding , into a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and gra@@ ce . 
and , as if by a mira@@ cle , he took his viol@@ in and began to play some exc@@ er@@ p@@ ts of viol@@ in conc@@ er@@ to@@ s and then asked me to play them to the end@@ : mend@@ el@@ s@@ sohn , t@@ cha@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , si@@ bel@@ i@@ us . 
we then began to talk about music , from bac@@ h to bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ hm@@ s , bru@@ ck@@ ner and all the other b &apos;s , from bar@@ to@@ k to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ onen . 
and i realized that not only did he have an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of music , but he also had a close personal relationship with it . 
he spoke of her with a passion and an understanding that i otherwise only know from my colleagues in the los angeles phil@@ harmon@@ ic . 
by playing music and talking about music , this para@@ no@@ id , conf@@ used man , who had just passed the streets of los angeles , had become a lo@@ vable , educ@@ ated , exc@@ ell@@ ent musi@@ cian trained in ju@@ ill@@ i@@ ard . 
music is medicine . music changes us . 
for nat@@ han@@ iel , music means spiritu@@ al health . 
because the music allows him to transform his thoughts and del@@ usi@@ ons into something real with the help of his imagination and creativity . 
and so he es@@ cap@@ es his tor@@ ment@@ ing states . 
i understood that this is the essen@@ ce of art . 
that &apos;s why we make musi@@ c@@ : to make something that is deep inside all of us , our emotions , through our arti@@ stic len@@ s , through our creativity into reality . 
and the reality of that expression reach@@ es us all , and moves , inspi@@ re@@ s and uni@@ tes us . 
as far as nat@@ han@@ iel was concerned , the music brought him back into a community of friends . 
the red@@ ee@@ ming power of music brought him back to a family of musi@@ cians who understood him , who recogni@@ zed his talent and respe@@ cted him . 
and i will play with nat@@ han@@ iel again and again , whether in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall or ski@@ d row , because it remin@@ ds me why i have become a musi@@ cian . 
many thanks . 
bru@@ no gi@@ uss@@ ani@@ : thank you . thank you . 
robert gu@@ p@@ ta . 
robert gu@@ p@@ ta@@ : i want to play something that i bra@@ zen@@ ly stol@@ e the cell@@ ist . 
i hope , you for@@ give me . 
so i knew many fish in my life . 
i only loved two . 
this first , that was more like a passionate aff@@ air . 
it was a nice fish , tas@@ ty , good consi@@ sten@@ cy , rich , a best@@ sel@@ ler on the men@@ u . 
what a fish . 
even better , it was bre@@ d in a@@ qua@@ culture according to the sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly highest standards of sustain@@ ability . 
so you could feel comfortable selling it . 
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months . 
one day , the bo@@ ss called the company and asked if i could speak at an event about the sustain@@ ability of the farm . 
&quot; naturally &quot; , i said . 
here was a company trying to solve what this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem has become for our coo@@ ks . how do we keep fish on our men@@ u@@ ? 
in the last 50 years we have fis@@ hed the se@@ as as we have be@@ aten fore@@ sts bald . 
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destruction . 
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tun@@ as , the hal@@ ib@@ ut , the sal@@ mon , the s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , they have collap@@ sed . 
there is almost nothing left . 
so a@@ qua@@ culture , fish far@@ ming , will be part of our future . 
many argu@@ ments against it . fish far@@ ms pollu@@ te the environment , most of them anyway , and they are in@@ efficient , we take tun@@ a . a great dis@@ advantage . 
he has a feed conver@@ sion of 15 to one . 
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish are needed to get a po@@ und of far@@ med tun@@ a . 
not very sustainable . 
it does not taste very good either . 
so here was finally a company that was trying to get it right . 
i wanted to support her . 
the day before the event , i called the head of public relation@@ s for the company . 
let &apos;s call him don . 
&quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous for growing so far out in the sea that you do not pollu@@ te the environment . &quot; 
&quot; that &apos;s true &quot; , he said . &quot; we are so far out that the waste from our fish is distribu@@ ted , not concent@@ rat@@ ed . &quot; 
and then he add@@ ed , &quot; we are basically a separate world . 
this feed conver@@ sion from 2.@@ 5 to 1 &quot; , he said . 
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot; 
2.@@ 5 to one , great . 
2.@@ 5 to one what@@ ? what are you feed@@ ing@@ ? &quot; 
&quot; sustainable proteins &quot; , he said . 
&quot; great &quot; , i said . hung up . 
and that night i was in bed thinking , what the hell is a sustainable prote@@ in@@ ? 
so i called the next day , just before the event , don . 
i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins , for exam@@ ple@@ ? &quot; 
he said he did not know that . he will ask . 
well , i pho@@ ned a few people in the company . nobody could give me a prop@@ er answer . until i finally pho@@ ned the sen@@ ior biolog@@ ist . 
let &apos;s call him too . 
&quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; what , for example , are sustainable prote@@ ins@@ ? &quot; 
well , he mentioned some alg@@ a@@ e and some fis@@ hm@@ e@@ al , and then he said , chicken pel@@ lets . 
i said , &quot; chicken pel@@ lets ? &quot; 
he sa@@ i@@ d@@ : &quot; yes , fe@@ ath@@ ers , skin , bone me@@ al , le@@ ft@@ over@@ s , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into for@@ age . &quot; 
i said , &quot; what percentage of your food is chic@@ ken@@ ? &quot; . 
in the assu@@ mption of maybe two percent . 
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent &quot; , he said . 
i said , &quot; don , what is sustainable about feed@@ ing chicken to fis@@ h@@ ? &quot; 
there was a long break in the line and he said , &quot; there are just too many chicken in the world . &quot; 
i fell away from this fish . 
no , not because i am a self-@@ ri@@ ght@@ e@@ ous and goo@@ d-@@ natur@@ ed . 
i am even . 
no , i have not really de@@ priv@@ ed myself of this fish , because , i swe@@ ar by god , that the fish tas@@ ted like chicken after this conversation . 
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love story . 
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way , the way you , the better you get to know your fish , the more you love the fish . 
i first ate it in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in . 
a friend of journ@@ alists had talked about this fish for a long time . 
she has somehow verk@@ upp@@ elt us . 
he came to the table with a bright , almost sh@@ immer@@ ing white color . 
the coo@@ k had over@@ coo@@ ked him . 
just twice . 
ama@@ z@@ ingly , he was still deli@@ cious . 
who can make a fish taste so good after being over@@ coo@@ ke@@ d@@ ? 
i can not , but this guy can . 
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact he is called mi@@ gu@@ el . 
and no , he did not coo@@ k the fish and he is not a coo@@ k . at least in the way she and i understand it . 
he is a biolog@@ ist at ve@@ ta la pal@@ ma . 
this is a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of spa@@ in . 
it is near the mouth of the river gu@@ ada@@ l@@ qui@@ vi@@ r . 
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ine@@ ans . 
they raised bee@@ f cat@@ tle on what were basically we@@ t@@ lands . 
they did that by dra@@ ining the land . 
they built this complicated series of chan@@ nel@@ s and they pus@@ hed water out of the country and out into the river . 
well , they could not make it work , not econom@@ ically . 
and eco@@ logi@@ cally it was a disaster . 
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which many birds are for this place . 
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company with environmental awareness bought the land . 
what have you done ? 
they have rever@@ sed the flow of water . 
they literally broke the le@@ ver . 
instead of exp@@ elling the water , they used the chan@@ nel@@ s to re@@ capture the water . 
they flo@@ od@@ ed the can@@ als . 
they created 1@@ 1,000 he@@ ct@@ are@@ s of fish re@@ aring - per@@ ch , mul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ mp , ee@@ l - and mi@@ gu@@ el and his company have completely rever@@ sed the ec@@ ological destruction . 
the farm is incredible . 
i mean , they have never seen anything like it . 
they star@@ e out at the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and all they see are flo@@ od@@ ed can@@ als and this den@@ se , lu@@ sh mar@@ ch . 
i was there with mi@@ gu@@ el not too long ago . 
he is an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part &quot; a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le to ki@@ ss &quot; , 
ok@@ a@@ y@@ ? there we were and f@@ ought our way through the we@@ t@@ lands and i gas@@ p and swe@@ at , i &apos;m squ@@ ir@@ ming to my kn@@ ee@@ s , and mi@@ gu@@ el holds a biology lec@@ ture in peace . 
here he emp@@ has@@ i@@ zes a rare gli@@ de . 
now he men@@ tions the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on . 
and here , here he sees a pattern of bun@@ d@@ les that remin@@ ds him of the tanz@@ ani@@ an gir@@ aff@@ e . 
it turns out that mi@@ gu@@ el spent most of his career in the mi@@ ku@@ m@@ i national park in africa . 
i asked him how he became such a fish exper@@ t . 
he sa@@ i@@ d@@ : &quot; fis@@ h@@ ? i do not know anything about fish . 
i am an exper@@ t in relationships . &quot; 
and then he goes and pl@@ ung@@ es into more talk about rare birds and alg@@ a@@ e and strange a@@ qua@@ tic plants . 
and do not get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biot@@ ic community un@@ plu@@ g@@ ged , that kind of way . 
it &apos;s great , but i was in love . 
and my head became wea@@ k over this over@@ grown piece of deli@@ cious fish that i had the night before . 
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how is it that your fish tas@@ tes so goo@@ d@@ ? &quot; 
he poin@@ ted to the alg@@ a@@ e . 
&quot; i know , boy , the alg@@ a@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible . 
but what do your fish e@@ at@@ ? 
how is the feed conver@@ sion@@ ? &quot; 
well , he goes on to tell me that it is such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild . 
the vege@@ table bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ kt@@ on , that is what feed@@ s the fish . 
the system is so healthy , it is completely self-@@ rene@@ wing . 
there is no food . 
ever heard of a farm that does not feed their anima@@ l@@ s@@ ? 
later in the day , i ro@@ de around with mi@@ gu@@ el on this property and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been to , &quot; how do you measure success@@ ? &quot; 
at the moment it was as if a film director had dem@@ and@@ ed a stage change . 
and we turned the corner and saw the most incredible sight , thousands upon thousands of pin@@ k fla@@ min@@ gos , a literally pin@@ k car@@ pet as far as the eye can see . 
&quot; that is success &quot; , he said . 
&quot; look at her bel@@ lies , pin@@ k . 
they fe@@ ast . &quot; 
fe@@ ast@@ ? i was completely conf@@ used . 
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do not you fe@@ ast your fish ? &quot; 
&quot; yes &quot; , he said . 
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to the birds . 
well , last year on this site were 6@@ 00@@ ,000 birds , more than 250 different species . 
today it has become the largest and one of the most important private bird reser@@ ves in europe . 
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is not a thri@@ ving bird population the last thing you want on a fish far@@ m@@ ? &quot; 
he sho@@ ok his head , no . 
he sa@@ i@@ d@@ : &quot; we are building exten@@ si@@ vely , not intensi@@ vely . 
this is an ec@@ ological network . 
the fla@@ min@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp . 
the sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kt@@ on . 
the pin@@ ker so the better the system . &quot; 
okay , let us think it over . a farm that does not feed its animals and a farm that meas@@ ures its success on the health of its predat@@ ors . 
a fish re@@ aring , but also a bird reser@@ ve . 
oh , and inci@@ dent@@ ally , these fla@@ min@@ gos should not even be there from the start . 
they bre@@ ed in a city 24@@ 0 kilometers away , where the soil conditions are better for the nest building . 
every morning you fly 24@@ 0 kilometers to the farm . 
and every ev@@ ening they fly 24@@ 0 kilometers back . 
they do this because they can follow the das@@ hed white line of high@@ way a@@ 9@@ 2 . 
seriously . 
i had imag@@ ined a kind of journey of the pengu@@ ins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el . 
i sa@@ i@@ d@@ : &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do you fly 24@@ 0 kilometers to the farm and then fly 24@@ 0 kilometers back in the ev@@ en@@ ing@@ ? 
do you do that for the childr@@ en@@ ? &quot; 
he looked at me as if i had just quot@@ ed a song by whit@@ ney hou@@ ston . 
he sa@@ i@@ d@@ : &quot; no , they do that because eating is better . &quot; 
i did not mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish , which was deli@@ cious , and i do not like fish skin . i do not like sau@@ t@@ é@@ ing her . i do not like it cris@@ p@@ y . 
it &apos;s that bit@@ ing , char@@ red taste . 
i almost never coo@@ k with it . 
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in southern spa@@ in , she did not really like fish skin at all . 
she tas@@ ted swe@@ et and pur@@ e , as if taking a bit@@ e from the ocean . 
i mentioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el and he no@@ dd@@ ed . 
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a spon@@ ge . 
she is the last defen@@ se before anything enter@@ s the body . 
it evolved in the course of evolution to absor@@ b imp@@ ur@@ it@@ ies . &quot; 
and then he add@@ ed , &quot; but our water has no imp@@ ur@@ it@@ ies . &quot; 
okay . a farm that does not feed your fish . a farm that meas@@ ures its success in the success of its predat@@ ors . 
and then i realized when he says a farm that has no imp@@ ur@@ it@@ ies , it is a huge under@@ stat@@ ement , because the water that flo@@ ws through this farm comes in from the river gu@@ ada@@ l@@ qui@@ vi@@ r . 
it is a river that car@@ ries with it all the things ri@@ vers no@@ wa@@ days tend to carry with them , chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , pe@@ sti@@ cide eff@@ lu@@ ent . 
and once it has f@@ ought through the system and leaves it , the water is cle@@ aner than when it came in . 
the system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans the water . 
not just a farm that does not feed your animals , not just a farm that meas@@ ures its success on the health of its predat@@ ors , but a farm that is literally a water treatment plant , and not just for those fish , but for you as well and me . 
because when the water flo@@ ws out , it sin@@ ks into the atlan@@ tic . 
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should , because that love story , however roman@@ tic , is also en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ing . 
it could be said that it is a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we are talking about bas@@ s or cat@@ tle . 
what we need now is a radi@@ cally new concept of agriculture , one in which food really tas@@ tes good . 
but for a lot of people this is a bit too radical . 
we are not reali@@ sts , we enjoy . we are lo@@ vers . 
we love wee@@ kl@@ y markets . we love small family businesses . we talk about regi@@ onal fo@@ ods . we eat organic . 
and if you say these are the things that assu@@ re the future of good food , someone stands up somewhere and says , &quot; hey people , i love pin@@ k fla@@ min@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world@@ ? 
how will you feed the world@@ ? &quot; 
may i be honest ? 
i do not like this question . 
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to feed more than just the world . 
a billion people will star@@ ve today . 
a billion - more than ever before - due to gro@@ ss ine@@ quali@@ ties in distribution , not total production . 
well , i do not like this question because it has determin@@ ed the logi@@ c of our food system for the last 50 years . 
feed cro@@ ps to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des to mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken to fish , and all the while the agri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; if we feed more people che@@ aper , how dre@@ ad@@ ful can that be@@ ? &quot; 
that was the motivation . it was the justi@@ fication . it was the business plan of american agriculture . 
we should name her , what she is , a business in progress , a business that quickly e@@ ats up ec@@ ological capital that makes this production possible . 
this is not a trade and it is not agriculture . 
our gra@@ in cham@@ ber is thre@@ ate@@ ned today , not because of dec@@ reas@@ ing supply , but because of di@@ min@@ ishing resour@@ ce@@ s@@ , 
not by the lat@@ est combin@@ es and tra@@ ctor inven@@ tions , but by ferti@@ le land , not by pump@@ ing , but by fresh water , not by cha@@ ins@@ aw@@ s , but by fore@@ sts , and not by fishing bo@@ ats and nets , but by fish in the sea . 
you want to feed the world@@ ? 
let &apos;s start with the questi@@ on@@ : how will we feed our@@ sel@@ ves@@ ? 
or better , how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed them@@ sel@@ ves@@ ? 
to do that , do not look at the agri@@ cultural industry model for the future . 
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done . 
capital , chemistry , and machin@@ ery are in the lead , and it never produced anything really good for food . 
let &apos;s look at the ec@@ ological model instead . 
this is the one that dra@@ ws on two billion years of work experience . 
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el@@ , 
plants that are not world@@ s apart , plants that rest@@ ore rather than use up , plants that grow exten@@ si@@ vely rather than just intensi@@ ve , farmers who are not just produ@@ cers , but experts in relation@@ shi@@ p@@ s@@ , 
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste . 
and if i &apos;m honest , you &apos;re a better coo@@ k than i &apos;ll ever be . 
you know , that &apos;s fine with me , because if that is the future of good food , it will be deli@@ cious . 
thank you . 
if i want to tell you a lesson today it is that the tot@@ ality of the data we consum@@ e is greater than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking of information over@@ load , i would like you to think about how we can use information in such a way that patterns emer@@ ge and we recognize trends that otherwise would not have become visible . 
so what we see here is a typical star@@ board char@@ t ar@@ ran@@ ged by age . 
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment . 
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t is that i can filter for a certain cause of death , say acci@@ dents . 
and immediately i see another pattern that results . 
and that &apos;s because people are the most active in the mid@@ -@@ range and they are most fra@@ il over here . 
we can go one step further and then re@@ ar@@ range the data and see that circu@@ lat@@ ory and cancer are the usual su@@ spec@@ ts , but not for everyone . 
now if we go on and sort by age , say 40 years or yo@@ unger , we see that acci@@ dents are even the main cause that people should worry about . 
and who@@ ever continu@@ es to research that this is especially true for men . 
so you realize that looking at information and data in this way is very remin@@ is@@ cent of swi@@ mming in a li@@ vely informa@@ tional graphic . 
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data why not for content it@@ sel@@ f@@ ? 
what we have here are the cover pictures of each one &quot; spor@@ ts illu@@ strated &quot; that were ever prin@@ ted . 
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online . 
you can test it in my rooms after my pres@@ entation . 
with pi@@ vo@@ t you can immer@@ se yourself in a decade . 
you can immer@@ se yourself in a specific year . 
you can jump directly to a specific issue . 
when i look here , i see the ath@@ let@@ es appe@@ aring in this issue and the spor@@ ts . 
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i &apos;ll click here to see all the issues men@@ tion@@ ing lan@@ ce arm@@ strong . 
now , if i just want to get a gr@@ ö@@ her over@@ view , i could think &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the top@@ ic of cy@@ clin@@ g@@ ? &quot; 
so i take a step back and expan@@ d the view . 
now i see gre@@ g le@@ mond . 
and so you get an idea that when you search information in this way , more tar@@ ge@@ ted , wid@@ er , zo@@ om in , zo@@ om out , then you do not search or just sur@@ f . 
you do something that is actually a little different . 
there is something in between and we think it changes the way information can be used . 
i would like to continue this idea a little bit with what is a bit crazy . 
what we did here is , we took every single wikipedia page and redu@@ ced it to a small sum@@ mary . 
the sum@@ mary con@@ tains a brief over@@ view and a symbol of the area from which it comes . 
i &apos;ll show just the top 500 of the most popular wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ as@@ ei@@ ten . 
but even in this limited view we can do a lot of things . 
immediately we get an impres@@ sion of the top@@ ics most popular on wikipedia . 
i will now discus@@ s the top@@ ic &apos;@@ ; government &apos;@@ ; choose . 
now , after i &apos;@@ ; government &apos;@@ ; i recognize that the wikipedia categ@@ ories that most clo@@ sely co@@ inci@@ de with the time magazine &quot; people of the year &quot; are . 
this is really important as it is an insi@@ ght that is not in a single wikipedia page . 
this is only recogni@@ za@@ ble when you go back a step and look at the whole . 
looking at a particular of these sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then turn into the theme of time maga@@ zin@@ es &quot; people of the year &quot; go in and see everyone together . 
now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government offi@@ ci@@ als . some come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here is my bo@@ ss . and one comes from the music department . 
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is also a ted prize win@@ ner . 
so we can now jump and take a look at all ted prize win@@ ners . 
you see , we are sur@@ fing the net for the first time as if it really is a net , not just from page to page , but much more abstra@@ ct . 
and so i want to show you something else that could be a little surprise . 
i just show them the new york times website here . 
pi@@ vo@@ t , this appli@@ cation - i do not want to call it a brow@@ ser@@ ; it really is not a brow@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it - and we bring this zo@@ om technology to every single web page like this one . 
so i can go back a step , and jump directly to a specific section . 
this is important because only by looking at web pages in this way , you can look at the whole internet history in the same way . 
so i can zo@@ om in on my history within a certain ti@@ me@@ frame . 
here is the state of the entire demon@@ stration that i have held to this point . 
and i can , so to speak , bring back everything that i have looked at today . 
and , if i go out again and look at everything , i can re@@ ar@@ range my course , perhaps after my sear@@ ch@@ -@@ past . here , i have to &apos;@@ ; ne@@ po@@ tis@@ tic &apos;@@ ; wanted , here after bing , or here after live lab@@ s pi@@ vo@@ t . 
and from here i can go into the page and call it back . 
it is a metaphor that is used over and over again , and each time it makes the whole image larger than the sum of the pieces of data . 
for now , in this world , we think that data is a cur@@ se . 
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load . 
we are talking about &quot; dro@@ w@@ ning in information &quot; , 
what if we could turn this situation around and turn the internet up@@ side down so that instead of going from one to the other , we can start going from many things to many things , there@@ by identi@@ fying patterns that otherwise would have rema@@ ined hi@@ dd@@ en@@ ? 
if we can do this , then this data tra@@ p will be , perhaps a new source of meaning@@ ful information . 
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get to know it . 
and if we know , then maybe we can even draw some wisdom from it . 
i stop that , thank you very much . 
i grew up with a good por@@ tion of science fi@@ ction . 
during my school days , i took the bus to school , one hour per rou@@ te every day . 
and my nose was always in a book , a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction book , that ki@@ dna@@ pped my thoughts into other world@@ s and narra@@ ted my deep@@ -@@ se@@ ated , ins@@ at@@ i@@ able curi@@ osity in a narra@@ tive way . 
this curi@@ osity was also refle@@ cted in the fact that whenever i was out of school i used to walk , wand@@ er and &quot; re@@ hea@@ r@@ se@@ &quot; through the fore@@ st@@ s@@ ; colle@@ cted , fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bee@@ tles and pon@@ d water , brought everything home and looked at it under the microscop@@ e . 
i was totally enth@@ usi@@ ast@@ ic about science , you know . 
it was always about the attemp@@ t to understand the world and explore the limit@@ s of the possible . 
and my love of science fi@@ ction seemed to be refle@@ cted in my environment , because back in the late &apos;@@ 6@@ 0s , we fle@@ w to the moon and explor@@ ed the deep sea . 
jac@@ ques cous@@ tea@@ u came to our living room with its fascinating programs that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonder@@ s that we had never imag@@ ined before . 
that probably went very well with the %science-fiction-role . 
and i was an artist . 
i could draw . i could paint . 
and since there were no video games nor this over@@ satur@@ ation of %computer-generated films nor the whole visual language in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head . 
we all had to do that at the time . when we as children read a book , we took the auth@@ or &apos;s descri@@ ption and proje@@ cted it on the screen in our heads . 
my reaction was to draw and paint %extraterrestrial , alien world@@ s , robots , spac@@ e@@ ships and all that . 
in math lessons i was constantly caught by the teacher , as i , hi@@ ding behind the text@@ book , paint@@ ed around . 
the creativity had to get out somehow . 
and something interesting happened . what fascin@@ ated me about jac@@ ques cous@@ tea@@ us broad@@ cas@@ ts was the thought of a completely un@@ known world here on our earth itself . 
sur@@ ely i would never reach an alien world with a spac@@ e@@ ship . that seemed pretty un@@ likely to me . 
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and it was as fascinating and ex@@ ot@@ ic as anything i had ever imag@@ ined when i read these books . 
so , when i was 15 , i decided to become a di@@ ver . 
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1 000 km from the ne@@ are@@ st ocean . 
but i did not let that dis@@ coura@@ ge me . 
i anno@@ yed my father until he finally found a di@@ ving school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , just across the bor@@ der where we lived . 
i made my di@@ ving licen@@ se in a pool of the y@@ mc@@ a in the middle of winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york . 
but the ocean , a real ocean , came to my face only two years later when we moved to california . 
since then , in the 40 years that have passed , i spent about 3,000 hours under water . 500 hours of it in di@@ ving bo@@ ats . 
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the sh@@ allo@@ wer oceans , is as rich in fascinating life as we can bar@@ ely imagine . 
nature &apos;s imagination knows no boundar@@ ies , unlike our own pit@@ i@@ ful human imagination . 
to this day , i feel the deep@@ est aw@@ e for what i see on my di@@ ves . 
and my love for the ocean continu@@ es , with the same intensi@@ ty as ever . 
when i cho@@ se a job as an adult , it was film@@ making . 
that seemed the best way to tell my inner ur@@ ge to tell stories , with my need to create and uni@@ te images . 
as a kid , i kept drawing com@@ ic books and stuff . 
so movies were the way to bring pictures and stories together . that mat@@ ched . 
of course , the stories i picked out were from the science fi@@ ction se@@ c@@ tion@@ : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator &quot; , &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; , and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; , 
at &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; i was able to combin@@ e my love for the under@@ water world and di@@ ving with film@@ making . 
so almost my two passion@@ s inter@@ twi@@ ned . 
something interesting happened with &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; : in order to solve a narra@@ tive problem in this film - and we had to create such a kind of liquid water crea@@ ture - we res@@ or@@ ted to computer gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g . 
what came out of it was the first %computer-generated soft@@ -@@ surface figure ever seen in a movie . 
although the film did not bring in any money , in fact , it was just recor@@ ding its production costs , but i noticed something intri@@ gu@@ ing@@ : audi@@ ences all over the world were mes@@ mer@@ i@@ zed by the magic that came from it . 
according to art@@ hu@@ r cla@@ r@@ ke &apos;@@ ; it is a well-@@ known fact that it is no longer possible to distin@@ gui@@ sh advanced technology and magic from one another . 
so they saw something mag@@ ical . 
and i found that incredibly exciting . 
and i thought to my@@ sel@@ f@@ : &quot; wow , that must necessarily be inclu@@ ded in the film art . &quot; 
so we went in &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 &quot; , my next film , much further . 
together with il@@ m we created the types of liquid metal there . the success depen@@ ded entirely on how this effect would arri@@ ve . 
and it worked . again we had created something mag@@ ical . and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we have already recor@@ ded a bit more money with the film . 
starting from these two experiences , a whole new world has been reach@@ ed , a whole new world of creativity for film@@ makers . 
so i started a company together with my good friend stan win@@ ston , who was the best ma@@ ke@@ -up and crea@@ ture designer at that time . it was called &quot; digital dom@@ ain &quot; , 
the basic idea of ​​this company was to ski@@ p the phase of analog@@ ue processes with opti@@ cal prin@@ ters etc . and to start with digital produ@@ ctions right away . 
we did that as well and ga@@ ined a competi@@ tive advantage for a while . 
but in the middle of the nin@@ et@@ ies we realized that we were moving too slowly in the crea@@ ture and character design - for which we had actually foun@@ ded the company . 
i had this piece &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; written to raise the bar to new hei@@ ghts in terms of visual effects and %computer-generated effects , with reali@@ stic human expres@@ sive characters created using c@@ g . and the main characters should all be c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g . 
but the bar pus@@ hed back pretty well . and the people in my company told me that for the time being we are not able to do that . 
so i moved that and made this other movie about the big ship going down . 
i think of the film@@ studio as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and juli@@ a on a ship &quot; sold . it became a love movie of epi@@ c propor@@ tions , a passionate film . 
secre@@ tly , however , i really wanted to di@@ ve down to the real wr@@ ec@@ k of the ti@@ tan@@ ic . 
that &apos;s why i made the film . 
that &apos;s the truth . the studio did not know that . 
but i convinced them by saying , &quot; we di@@ ve to the wr@@ ec@@ k , we film the real wr@@ ec@@ k . 
we will show it in the opening sequence of the film . 
that is very important . it is a good han@@ ger for marketing . &quot; 
and i pers@@ u@@ aded her to finan@@ ce an expedi@@ tion . 
sounds crazy . but that goes back to the fact that your own imagination can create a reality . 
in fact , six months later , we created a reality in which i found myself in a russi@@ an di@@ ve boat , four kilometers below the surface of the north atlan@@ tic , and watched the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a bul@@ l@@ se@@ ye . 
that was not a movie , no h@@ d , that was real . 
well , that really ble@@ w me away . 
and the prepar@@ ations were enormous . we had to build c@@ ameras and head@@ lights and everything . 
and i noticed how much these deep@@ -@@ sea di@@ ves res@@ em@@ bled a space mission . 
well , they were also highly technical and requi@@ red exten@@ sive planning . 
you clim@@ b into this cap@@ su@@ le , then you flo@@ at down into this dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environment , where there is no hope of sal@@ vation unless you can do it yourself . 
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like being in a science fi@@ ction movie . 
that is really cool . &quot; 
i was obs@@ essed with explor@@ ing the deep sea . 
in any case , of the part that has to do with curi@@ osity and science . it was all . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ osity . it was imagination . 
and it was an experience hollywood could not give me . 
because , you know , i could imagine a being for which we could then create a visual effect . but i could not imagine what i would see outside the window . 
on some of the following expedi@@ tions , i have seen beings in ther@@ mal spr@@ ings , and sometimes things i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and science at the time we saw them no words found . 
that really up@@ set me , and i wanted more . 
and so i made a some@@ what unusual decision . 
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic &quot; i said to myself , &quot; al@@ right , i want to put my ful@@ l-@@ time job as a film@@ maker in hollywood on ice and become a ful@@ l-@@ time resear@@ cher for a while . &quot; 
and then we started , we di@@ ved to &quot; bis@@ mar@@ ck &quot; , and explor@@ ed them with robo@@ tic vehi@@ cles . 
we re@@ turned to the wr@@ ec@@ k of the ti@@ tan@@ ic . 
we took small robots that we had built , which un@@ fol@@ ded a fi@@ ber@@ glass cab@@ le . 
our inten@@ tion was to di@@ ve in and look at the inter@@ ior of the ship , which had never been done before . 
nobody had ever explor@@ ed the inter@@ ior of the wr@@ ec@@ k . one had no means for it . so we developed the necessary technology . 
now and then , sitting on the dec@@ k of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a di@@ ve boat , i see plan@@ ks that are quite similar to those bo@@ ards here , and that i know once the band played there . 
and i fly with a small robot vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ dor@@ s of the ship . 
i only use it , but my consciousness is inside the vehicle . 
it felt like i was physi@@ cally present within the shi@@ p@@ wr@@ ec@@ k of the ti@@ tan@@ ic . 
that was the most sur@@ real form of de@@ ja v@@ u i have ever experienced . because before i turned around each corner , i always knew what would appear in the same light con@@ e of the vehicle , since i had run over the film set for months , when we turned the film . 
the set was an exac@@ t copy of the ship &apos;s blu@@ ep@@ rin@@ ts . 
so that was a very strange experience . 
she made me realize this tele@@ pres@@ ence experience that you can use such robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars and so shift your own consciousness into the vehicle , into this other form of existence . 
it really was pro@@ foun@@ dly profound 
and maybe even a small out@@ look on what might happen in a few decades , if you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to do research or do other things , in all the possible post-@@ human future scen@@ ari@@ os that i think of as sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction fan can introduce . 
after these expedi@@ tions , we really began to appreci@@ ate what we saw down there , such as those deep@@ -@@ sea spr@@ ings where we saw these incredibly ba@@ ff@@ ling animals . these are quas@@ i alien , but here on earth . 
they live with the help of chemo@@ syn@@ thesis . 
they do not exist in a sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ based system as we do that . 
and so you see animals that are next to a 500 degrees cel@@ si@@ us hot that they can survive there . 
at the same time i was also very interested in space science , that was again the science fi@@ ction influence of my childhood . 
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who are dealing with nasa and sitting in the nasa coun@@ cil of experts and planning real space mis@@ sions . you go to russi@@ a , go through the bio@@ medical proto@@ co@@ l before the mission , including all the tri@@ mm@@ ings , then fly to the international space station and take our 3d camera systems with you . 
that was fascinating . 
but in the end , it came down to me taking space scientists with us into the deep sea . 
i took them with me and gave them access to the world belo@@ w@@ : astro@@ biolog@@ ists , planet scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the spr@@ ings so they could look around , sam@@ ple and test instru@@ ments , and so on . 
we made docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but we actually did science , more pre@@ cis@@ el@@ y@@ : space science . 
so the circle between my existence as a science fi@@ ction fan , then as a child , and the imple@@ ment@@ ation into the reality closed . 
in the course of this expedi@@ tion , i learned a lot . 
i learned a lot about science . but now i think you certainly , a director must also be able to lead a leader like a ship &apos;s cap@@ tain or something . 
but i did not understand much of leadership before i started these expedi@@ tions . 
because at one point i had to tell my@@ sel@@ f@@ : &quot; what am i doing her@@ e@@ ? 
why do i do th@@ at@@ ? what happen@@ s@@ ? &quot; 
these stupid movies do not bring us any money . 
we &apos;re just recor@@ ding the production costs . no tra@@ ce of fam@@ e . 
everyone thinks i am between &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic &quot; and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; ran away and nai@@ led my nai@@ ls on a to@@ we@@ l on the beach somewhere . 
i have made all these films , these docum@@ ent@@ ary films , for a very small audience . 
no fam@@ e , no honor , no money . what are you doing ? 
you do it for the sa@@ ke of the task , for the sa@@ ke of challenge - and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment there is . you make it because of the explor@@ er noise , and because of the strange connection that ari@@ ses when a small group of people forms a team . 
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked together for years without inter@@ ruption . sometimes we were at sea for 2 to 3 months in a row . 
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the respect you have for one another , because you have ma@@ stere@@ d a task that you can not explain to anyone else . 
when one re@@ turns to land and says , &quot; we had to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the sound atten@@ u@@ ation , and all around it , all the engineering , and the diffic@@ ulti@@ es , the human capacity to work at sea &quot; , then you just can not explain the other one . it &apos;s like poli@@ ce@@ men or soldiers who have gone through something together and know that they can never explain it to anyone . 
there ari@@ ses a connection , a mu@@ tual respect . 
so when i came back to my next movie &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; i tried to use the same style of leadership , that of respe@@ cting your team and respe@@ cting it in return . 
that really changed the dynam@@ ics . 
so there i was again with a small team on un@@ known terr@@ ain . we turned &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new technology that did not exist before . 
tremend@@ ously exciting . 
a tremendous challenge . 
and we became a family for four and a half years . 
this changed my way of making films completely . 
there were people who thought we had mi@@ mi@@ cked these ocean creatures really well and transpor@@ ted them to the planet pan@@ dor@@ a . 
for me it was more of a princi@@ ple@@ d way to do my job , the actual process that has changed in the result . 
so what can we conclu@@ de from all thi@@ s@@ ? 
which lessons have we lear@@ ne@@ d@@ ? 
i believe that curi@@ osity is the top pri@@ ority . 
it is the most powerful human property . 
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality . 
and the respect of your team is more important than any lau@@ re@@ l in the world . 
come to me young film@@ makers who say , &quot; give me some ad@@ vice on how to do this . &quot; 
and i say , &quot; do not lim@@ it yourself . 
others will do that for you . do not do it yourself , do not bet against yourself . but take risks on you . &quot; 
nasa has such a favorite phr@@ as@@ e@@ : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot; 
but in art and in exploration , failure has to be an alternative , because it guar@@ ant@@ ee@@ s a lea@@ p of faith there . 
no major %innovation-demanding vent@@ ure was ever under@@ taken without risk . 
you have to be prepared to take on such risks . 
that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is quite an alternative , but fear is not . thank you . 
today i talk to you about energy and climate . 
and that may be surprising given that my ful@@ l-@@ time emplo@@ y@@ ment at the foundation is main@@ ly about vac@@ cin@@ es and see@@ ds , about the things we need to inven@@ t and deliver to en@@ able the poor@@ est 2 billion people to live a better life . 
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , in fact even more important than anyone else on the planet . 
climate deter@@ i@@ or@@ ation means that their cro@@ ps will not grow over many years . we rain too much or too little . things will change as their frag@@ il@@ e environment can not stand . 
that leads to hunger dying . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to un@@ rest . 
so , a climate change will be terrible for them . 
in addition , the energy price is very important to them . 
the fact is that if you could only reduce the price by one thing , redu@@ cing energy would be by far the most effective way of redu@@ cing poverty . 
well , the energy price has fallen over time . 
in fact , the pro@@ gressi@@ ve society is based on energy advan@@ ces . 
the coal revolution dro@@ ve the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century there was a rapi@@ d fall in the price of electricity and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air condi@@ tion@@ ers , we can make modern materials and do so many things . 
so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . 
but , if we reduce the price - let &apos;s cut the price in half - we hit a new barri@@ er and this barri@@ er is related to co2 . 
co2 war@@ ms the planet and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually pretty clear . 
they add up the expe@@ ll@@ ed co2 , which leads to the temperature increase and this temperature increase has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect consequ@@ ence that natural eco@@ systems can not adap@@ t to such rapi@@ d changes and th@@ us complete systems collapse . 
well , the exac@@ t connection between a co2 increase and the resul@@ ting temperature change and where their further consequences are , there are some ambi@@ gui@@ ties , but not very many . 
and there is no dou@@ bt how bad these consequences will be . but they will be extremely ba@@ d@@ ! 
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists several ti@@ mes@@ : &quot; do we really have to come down to near zer@@ o@@ ? 
is not enough half or a quar@@ ter@@ ? &quot; 
the answer is@@ : until we come close to zero , the temperature will continue to rise . 
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge . 
it is very different from saying that we have a 3@@ .@@ 5 m high tru@@ ck that has to come under a 3 m bridge . you can squ@@ ee@@ ze it almost under it . 
this one has to go all the way down to zero . 
well , every year we em@@ it a lot of carbon dio@@ xide , over 26 billion tons . 
each american about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one . 
on average , there are about 5 tons for everyone on the planet . 
and somehow we have to bring about changes that bring it down to zero . 
it has been ris@@ ing constantly . 
only different economic changes have influ@@ enced it at all and we have to go from a rapi@@ d increase to a redu@@ ction and a redu@@ ction to zero . 
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors . a bit multi@@ pli@@ cation . you have this thing left - co2 - that you want to bring to zero and that will depen@@ d on the number of people , the services that each person uses on average , the average energy for each service and the co2 e@@ mitt@@ ed per unit of energy becomes . 
so let &apos;s take a look at each factor and think about how to get it to zero . 
probably one of these numbers must come very close to zero . 
well that &apos;s basic al@@ geb@@ ra , but let &apos;s go through it . 
first , we have the population . 
6@@ .@@ 8 billion people live to@@ da@@ y@@ , 
and it &apos;s going up to 9 billion . to move to 9 billion . 
if we are very successful with new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care and re@@ productive medicine , we could probably reduce this by 10@@ % to 15@@ % , but at present we see a gra@@ dient of 1.@@ 3 . 
the second factor is the services we use . 
that inclu@@ des everything , the food we eat , clo@@ the@@ s , television , hea@@ ting . 
these are very good things and poverty redu@@ ction means making these services available to almost anyone on the planet . 
it &apos;s great that this number is increasing . 
in the rich world , in the upp@@ er billion , we could probably cut cor@@ ners and use less , but on average , this number will increase each year , more than dou@@ bling in total , the number of services provi@@ ded per person . 
here we see a very basic service . is there light at home so you can read the home@@ work@@ ? 
and these students do not have it , so they go out and read their home@@ work under the street light . 
now , with e , the energy pro service , there is finally good news . 
we have something that does not ris@@ e@@ , 
due to various success@@ es in the ligh@@ ting sector , by other types of cars , by new metho@@ ds in building , there are many services whose energy expen@@ di@@ ture can be redu@@ ced by some 9@@ 0@@ % . 
in other services , such as the production of ferti@@ li@@ zer@@ s , 10@@ 5 00@@ : 0@@ 5@@ : 5@@ 6@@ ,000 - &amp; amp ; g@@ t@@ ; 00@@ : 0@@ 5@@ : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or a@@ vi@@ ation or air traffic , the travel for impro@@ ve@@ ments is much smaller . 
over@@ all , if we are optimis@@ tic , we may get a redu@@ ction of a factor of 3 or maybe even a factor of 6 . 
but in the first three fac@@ tors , we have now gone from 26 billion to maybe 13 billion . and that &apos;s just not en@@ ough@@ ! 
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor - and this will be a key factor - that &apos;s the amount of co2 e@@ mitt@@ ed per unit of energy . 
it beg@@ s the question , if you can get it to zero . 
if you burn co@@ al@@ : no . 
if you burn natural gas@@ : no . 
almost every method of producing electricity today em@@ its co2 , except for rene@@ wa@@ ble energy and nuclear energy . 
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system . 
we need energy wonder . 
if i now understand the term &quot; mira@@ cle &quot; i do not mean the impossible . 
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the p@@ c is a mira@@ cle . 
the internet and its services is a mira@@ cle . 
the people here have contribu@@ ted to the development of many of these wonder@@ s . 
usually there is no dea@@ d@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a certain date . 
normally , one stands almost just off and some come , others not . 
but in this case we have to go full thro@@ ttle and get a mira@@ cle in a very short time . 
well , i wonder@@ ed , how can i really get that over@@ ? 
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that kind@@ les people &apos;s imag@@ i@@ nation@@ ? 
i reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed last year when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os and somehow people liked that . 
the idea really became tan@@ gi@@ ble for you , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ ski@@ to@@ s . 
for energy this occur@@ red to me . 
i decided that rele@@ as@@ ing fire@@ flies would be my year &apos;s contribu@@ tor to the environment here . 
so here are a few natural fire@@ flies . 
i am assu@@ red that they will not bit@@ e . in fact you will not even leave the glass . 
well , there are all sorts of gam@@ ep@@ lay solutions like these , but they do not bring much . 
we need solutions , either one or more , that have uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able sc@@ al@@ ability and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able reli@@ ability . and although there are many direc@@ tions people are looking for , i really only see five who can meet those big dem@@ ands . 
i &apos;ve ski@@ pped ti@@ des , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els . 
they may make a mod@@ est contribu@@ tion , and if they do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core message here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can not give up any of them because they inti@@ mid@@ ate us because everyone has significant problems . 
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fu@@ els , burning either coal or natural gas . 
what you have to do there may seem simple , but it is not . you would have to capture all the co2 that comes out of the chi@@ m@@ ney after burning , liqu@@ ef@@ y it under pressure and then store it somewhere and hope it sta@@ ys there . 
there are some pilot projects that can do that at 6@@ 0@@ % - 8@@ 0@@ % , but getting it at 10@@ 0@@ % will be very difficult . and reach@@ ing an agre@@ ement for the stor@@ age of the co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the stock time question . 
who will ens@@ ure it@@ ? 
who can guar@@ an@@ tee something literally billions of times bigger than any kind of gar@@ bag@@ e imag@@ in@@ able in nuclear and other thin@@ gs@@ ? 
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ me . 
so that &apos;s a tough nu@@ t to cra@@ ck . 
ne@@ x@@ t@@ : nuclear energy . 
it also has three big problems . the costs are high , especially in highly regu@@ lat@@ ed countries . the question of safety , that one really feels that nothing can go wrong , despite the human co@@ operation , that the fuel is not used for weapons . 
and what do you do with the gar@@ bag@@ e@@ ? 
because although he is not very tal@@ l , there are a lot of concern@@ s . 
so three very difficult problems that may be sol@@ vable , and therefore one should work on . 
i sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed the last three of the five . 
it is the rene@@ wa@@ ble energi@@ es , as they are often called . 
and they too - although it &apos;s great that they do not need fuel - they have some dra@@ w@@ back@@ s . 
on the one hand , the energy den@@ sity that these technologies generate is dra@@ matically lower than that of power plants . 
these are low-@@ energy , one speak@@ s of many square kilometers , a thousand times more area than a normal power plant . 
in addition , these sources are subject to inter@@ rup@@ tion@@ s@@ : 
the sun does not shi@@ ne all day , it does not shi@@ ne every day , and the wind does not blo@@ w constantly . 
therefore , if one depen@@ ds on these sources , one has to have a way to get the energy even in times when it is not available . 
so there are big pri@@ cing challenges here . there are challenges in the trans@@ fer . for example , if we say that the source of energy is outside the country , then they not only need technology , they also have to deal with the risk that energy comes from el@@ se@@ where . 
and there is the stor@@ age problem . 
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batter@@ ies that are ma@@ de@@ : the ones for cars , computers , cell phones , fla@@ sh@@ lights , for everything . and that &apos;s what i compared to the amount of electr@@ onic energy the world uses . i found that all the batter@@ ies we produce now could store less than 10 minutes of total energy . 
so we need a big break@@ through here , something that will be better by a factor of 100 than the approach@@ es currently . 
that is not impossible , but it is not so easy . 
this happens when you try to bring these broken sources over say 20@@ % - 30@@ % of the consumption . 
if you want to rely on it 10@@ 0@@ % , you need an incredible mira@@ cle battery . 
well , where should we go@@ : what is the right approach@@ ? 
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we reach the go@@ al@@ ? 
what we need are many companies working on it . hundreds . 
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people . 
many will say they are cra@@ zy@@ ! it &apos;s good . 
i think there are many here in the ted group who are already involved there . 
bill big has several companies , including one called e@@ solar which has great solar ther@@ mal technologies . 
vin@@ od k@@ ho@@ sl@@ a invest@@ s in do@@ zens of companies that do great things and have interesting opportunities and i try to support that . 
nat@@ han my@@ hr@@ vol@@ d and i are finan@@ cing a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is pur@@ su@@ ing the nuclear approach . 
there are some innova@@ tions in the nuclear fiel@@ d@@ ; mod@@ ular , liquid . 
development has stopped in this industry some time ago , so it &apos;s no surprise that some good concep@@ ts are lying around . 
the terr@@ apo@@ wer concept means that instead of a part of the ur@@ an , the one percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 9@@ 9@@ % , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . 
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea . 
but in fact , it had been thought about for a long time , but you could never reas@@ on@@ ably simul@@ ate whether it would work , but since there are modern super@@ computers , you can simul@@ ate it and see th@@ at@@ : ye@@ s@@ ! with the right materials approach , it looks like it works . 
and because you burn that 9@@ 9@@ % , the cost profi@@ le is much better . 
in fact , you burn the gar@@ bag@@ e and you can even use the waste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors as fuel . 
instead of wor@@ rying about it , they just burn it . a great thing . 
the ur@@ ani@@ um is gradu@@ ally consum@@ ed , a bit like a can@@ d@@ le . 
they see that it is a kind of pil@@ la@@ r , often called a &quot; wander@@ ing wave re@@ actor &quot; desig@@ nat@@ ed . 
that really sol@@ ves the fuel problem . 
here is a picture of a place in ken@@ tu@@ cky . 
that &apos;s the waste , the 9@@ 9@@ % . it has the part that is bur@@ ned today , taken out so it is used up ur@@ ani@@ um . 
that dri@@ ves the u .@@ s . for hundreds of years . 
and if you filter ocean water cheap and easy , you get enough fuel for the rest of the life of the planet . 
you know , there are many challenges , but it is one of many hundreds of concep@@ ts we need to move forward . 
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success . 
how should our cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate look lik@@ e@@ ? 
well , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to achieve and then we &apos;ll talk about the inter@@ medi@@ ate step . 
many talk about an 8@@ 0@@ % redu@@ ction by 20@@ 50 . 
it is really important that we get there . 
the rema@@ ining 20@@ % ​​will be produced in poor countries , as well as some agriculture . hopefully , the forest floor and ce@@ ment will be clean by then . 
so , to reach this 8@@ 0@@ % , the industri@@ alized countries , including countries like china , have to completely switch their generation of electricity . 
the other note says if we use zero emissions technology , if it &apos;s used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way to getting it to the rest . 
that &apos;s super important . 
this becomes a key element of this cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate . 
if we go back from there , what should the 20@@ 20 cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate look lik@@ e@@ ? 
it should again cont@@ ain the two elements . 
we should use the effec@@ tiv@@ eness meas@@ ures to bring about redu@@ ction . the less we em@@ it , the lower the co2 sum will be and th@@ us also the temperature . 
but actually this note is for the things we do that do not completely lead to the big redu@@ ctions , just the same , or even slightly less important than the other one , which represents the speed of innovation for these break@@ through@@ s . 
we have to follow these break@@ through@@ s with full thro@@ ttle and we can measure that in company fig@@ ures , pilot projects and regu@@ lat@@ ory changes . 
there are many great books on the subject . 
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david mc@@ kay &apos;s &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot; 
they are really doing it and creating a frame@@ work in which this can be wid@@ ely discus@@ sed because we need support from all sides . 
there is a lot that has to come together . 
that is a wish . 
a very conc@@ re@@ te wish that we inven@@ t this technology . 
if you only allow me one wish for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a vac@@ cin@@ e , and i love that , or i could choose that , which is half the energy price without co2 being invented . i would take that wish . 
this has the biggest impact . 
if we do not get that wish , the dig@@ ging between long-term and shor@@ t-@@ term thinking people will be terrible , between the us and china , between poor and rich countries . and almost all the lives of this 2 billion will be much worse . 
so what do we have to do@@ ? 
for which meas@@ ures do i appe@@ al@@ ? 
we have to work for more research fund@@ ing . 
when countries meet in places like kop@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen , they should not just talk about co2 . 
you should discus@@ s this innovation strategy and you would be sho@@ cked by the ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ously small money spent on these innovative approach@@ es . 
we need market in@@ centi@@ ves , co2 tax@@ es , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a price signal . 
we have to spread the message . 
we need to gui@@ de dialo@@ gue more ration@@ ally and fully , and also the things that are being done by the government . 
it is an important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it . 
many thanks . 
many thanks . 
thank you . thank you ! 
many thanks . just to get a better understanding of terr@@ apo@@ wer - first of all , can you give us an idea of ​​the size of this invest@@ ment@@ ? 
bill gat@@ es@@ : to do the simulation on a super@@ computer , to get all the great scientists , what we did , we only need a few tens of millions . and even if we tes@@ ted our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure it works proper@@ ly , you &apos;re only in the 10@@ 0s . 
the difficult step is to build the first re@@ actor , to find billions more , the regu@@ lations and the place that actually buil@@ ds the first of them . 
as soon as the first one is finished , when it works as promis@@ ed , then everything is very clear , because the economy , the energy den@@ sity is so different from nuclear energy , as we know it . 
to understand this cor@@ rec@@ tly , that means building deep into the ground , almost like a verti@@ cal colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , that spent ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts up and works its way down@@ ? 
b@@ g@@ : exactly . today , you always have to re@@ fill the re@@ actor , so there are many people and many contro@@ ls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and bring things in or out . this is not good ! 
but if you have cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years - think of a pil@@ la@@ r - that you bur@@ y without the complex@@ it@@ ies . 
and it si@@ ts there and bur@@ ns for 60 years and then it &apos;s done . 
a nuclear re@@ actor that off@@ ers a solution for the gar@@ bag@@ e itself . 
b@@ g@@ : yes . well , what happens to the gar@@ bag@@ e@@ : you can let it sit - there is much less gar@@ bag@@ e with this method - then take it and pack it in the next re@@ actor and burn it on . 
and we start by taking the gar@@ bag@@ e that already exists in those cool@@ ers or dr@@ y-@@ tan@@ ks by the re@@ ac@@ tors . that &apos;s our starting fuel . 
so , what was a problem for these re@@ ac@@ tors is what we fill in ours , and th@@ us the volu@@ me of waste is dra@@ matically redu@@ ced during this process . 
but while talking to different people in the world about these possi@@ bili@@ tie@@ s@@ , 
where is the greatest interest , so what really imple@@ ment@@ ? 
b@@ g@@ : well , we have not decided on a place yet and there are a lot of interesting rules of disc@@ los@@ ure for everything that is &quot; nuclear &quot; be@@ ars in the name . there was great interest and the company &apos;s people were in russi@@ a , india , china . . . i was here and met the energy minister and talked about how this fit@@ s in with the energy agenda . 
i am optimis@@ tic . you know , the french and the japanese have done something about it . 
this is a vari@@ ant of a thing that has been done . 
this is an important step forward , but it is like a fast re@@ actor and some countries have built it , so anyone who has imple@@ mented a fast re@@ actor is a can@@ di@@ date for our first one . 
in your imag@@ i@@ nation@@ : ti@@ me@@ frame and prob@@ ability to really bring something to life@@ ? 
b@@ g@@ : now we need one of those sc@@ al@@ able , %power-generating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to inven@@ t and then 20 years to dep@@ lo@@ y . 
this is almost the dea@@ d@@ line , which has shown us the environmental models that we have to comp@@ ly with . 
and , you know , terr@@ apo@@ wer , if all goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy . 
and fortunately , there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds who , just as their approach@@ es work , can help pro@@ mote them for their pil@@ ots . 
and it would be best if there are more than one , because then you could use a mix@@ ture . 
in any case , we need a solution . 
reg@@ ar@@ ding the big potential break@@ through@@ s , is this the biggest they know@@ ? 
b@@ g@@ : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing . 
that would have been without the environmental challenge , but it still makes it so much more important . 
there are other innovative companies in the nuclear sector . 
you know , we do not know their work as well as this , but there is the mod@@ ular method , that &apos;s a different approach . 
there is a liquid re@@ actor type that seems a bit difficult , but maybe they say that about us . 
and so there are different ones , but the nice thing is that a ur@@ ani@@ um molecule has a million times as much energy as , say , a carbon molecule and therefore , if you can hand@@ le the problems and that are main@@ ly the radiation , the foot@@ print and the costs , the potential plays , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in their own lea@@ gue . 
if that does not work , then what@@ ? 
do we need to take emergen@@ cy meas@@ ures to try to keep the ground temperature stab@@ le@@ ? 
b@@ g@@ : when you get into this situation , it &apos;s like eating too much , and you &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of a heart attack . what do you do the@@ n@@ ? you may need a heart surgery or something similar . 
there is a research called ge@@ o@@ engineering that uses different techniques to del@@ ay the warming so we could get 20 or 30 years longer to come together . 
this is just an insu@@ ran@@ ce method . 
we hope that we do not need that . 
some people say that you should not work on insu@@ ran@@ ce because you might be la@@ zy , so you keep eating because you know someone will save your heart surgery . 
i do not know if this is wise , consi@@ der@@ ing the importance of this problem , but there is now a ge@@ o@@ engineering debate on whether to have it available in case things get faster , or that innovation takes longer , as we expect . 
climate skep@@ tic@@ s@@ : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for them , perhaps to convince them@@ ? 
b@@ g@@ : well , unfortunately the skep@@ tics live in very different cam@@ ps . 
those who make scientific argu@@ ments are very few . 
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clou@@ ds that shift thin@@ gs@@ ? 
there are very , very few things that you can even say of which there is a chance in a million . 
the main problem here is similar to aids . 
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it much later . 
and that &apos;s why , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea is to invest in something that you only get something from later - and , mor@@ e@@ over , the investment is not so clear . in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report is not necessarily the worst scen@@ ario and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big dra@@ ma . 
the fact is that this inse@@ curity should worry us . 
but my dream here is that if you can do it econom@@ ically , and at the same time elimin@@ ate the co2 , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; al@@ right , i do not care that it em@@ its no co2 , i almost wish it did but i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than the previous method . &quot; 
and that would be your answer to the b@@ j@@ ö@@ r@@ n lo@@ m@@ bor@@ g argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals are suffering , poverty redu@@ ction , fighting malaria and so on , making it a du@@ m@@ b one was@@ ting resources is invest@@ ing money while there are better things we can do . 
b@@ g@@ : well , the actual expen@@ ses for the research - say the u .@@ s . should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today - that &apos;s not so dra@@ matic . 
this should not affect other things . 
then one comes to large sum@@ s of money , and here reas@@ on@@ able people can contra@@ dic@@ t , if one has something , which is not econom@@ ical , and tries to finan@@ ce that . for me , the most waste happens here . 
unless you are very close to a cost break and only finan@@ ce the learning cur@@ ve . i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much che@@ aper . 
if the sm@@ ear you get is a very high energy price , then only the rich can keep up . 
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing our lifest@@ yle . 
but for the bottom two billion it is a disaster . 
and even lo@@ m@@ bor@@ g thinks about it . 
his new idea is no@@ w@@ : &quot; why is research not being discus@@ sed any@@ mor@@ e@@ ? &quot; 
he is still associated with the skep@@ tics camp because of his previous stories , but he under@@ stands that this is a very lon@@ ely group and that &apos;s why he &apos;s bringing the research argument now . 
and that &apos;s a line of thought that i think is appropriate . 
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it suppor@@ ts . 
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here when i say , i really hope that your wish will come true . thanks alo@@ t . 
b@@ g@@ : thanks . 
a few years ago , here at ted , peter ski@@ ll@@ man created a design cont@@ est called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge &quot; in front . 
the idea is pretty simple . teams of four need to build the largest possible free@@ standing structure with 20 spa@@ gh@@ et@@ ti , appro@@ x . 1@@ m ad@@ he@@ sive ta@@ pe , appro@@ x . 1@@ m thre@@ ad and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . 
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low must be on top . 
and , although it seems really easy , it is actually really hard because it forces people to work together very quickly . 
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea and i turned it into a design work@@ shop . 
it was a huge success . 
since then , i &apos;ve run about 70 work@@ sho@@ ps worldwide , with students , develop@@ ers , and architec@@ ts , even ct@@ os from the fortun@@ e 50 companies , and there &apos;s something about this task that gives a deep sense of the nature of the collaboration , and i want to share some of it with them , 
usually , most people start to ori@@ ent themselves on the task . 
they talk about it , they think about what it &apos;s going to look like , they &apos;re fighting for power@@ , 
then invest a little time in planning and organization . they ske@@ tch and put out spa@@ gh@@ et@@ ti . 
they invest a great deal of their time in the construction of constantly growing structures 
and finally , just before you run out of time , someone takes the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and they gent@@ ly set it on the top , step back and &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; ! ad@@ mir@@ e your work . 
but what happens then , almost always , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; to a &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the whole thing to bend and collapse . 
there are a number of people who are much more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; -@@ moment@@ es have more than others , and among the worst are fresh b@@ w@@ l gradu@@ ates . 
they lie , they che@@ at , they are conf@@ used and produce really scan@@ ty things . 
and of course , there are teams that are much more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; - have structures and among the best are fresh gradu@@ ates of the kinder@@ garten . 
and that &apos;s pretty amazing . 
as peter told us , they produce not only the highest to@@ wers , but also the most interesting structures of all . 
what you might ask is@@ : how com@@ e@@ ? why ? what &apos;s up with them ? 
and peter tells us@@ : &quot; none of the children invest time in being the bo@@ ss of spa@@ gh@@ et@@ ti g@@ m@@ b@@ h &quot; , 
they do not invest time in power strug@@ gles . 
but there is another reason . 
nam@@ ely that b@@ w@@ l students were trained to find the right plan , ok@@ ! 
and then realize it . 
what happens then , when you take the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low to the extreme , you have no more time and what happen@@ s@@ ? 
it is a crisis . 
sounds familiar , what@@ ? 
what kinder@@ garten children do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and build prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , always with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so that they have several times the opportunity to re@@ pair di@@ lap@@ i@@ dat@@ ed prototyp@@ es . 
designers recognize this kind of co@@ operation as the core of an it@@ er@@ ative process . 
and with every attemp@@ t , the children get inst@@ ant feedback which works and what does not . 
that &apos;s why the power to work with prototyp@@ es is essential - but let &apos;s see how different teams operate . 
the average for most is about 50@@ c@@ m , b@@ w@@ l students manage half of it , law@@ yers a little more , but not much , kinder@@ garten children are better than the adults . 
who is the most success@@ ful@@ ? 
architec@@ ts and engineers , fortunately . 
1@@ m is the highest i &apos;ve seen . 
and why ? because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and %self-reinforcing geome@@ tri@@ c patterns are the key to building stable structures . 
ce@@ os are slightly above average . but here it gets interesting . 
if you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive admini@@ strat@@ or on the team , they will be signific@@ antly better . 
it &apos;s incredible . they look around and realize , &quot; this team will win . &quot; 
they can predict that . why is that possi@@ ble@@ ? 
because they have special process support skills . 
they gui@@ de the process , they understand it . 
and the team that govern@@ s and pay@@ s attention to the work will signific@@ antly improve the performance of the team . 
speci@@ alized skills and process skills and their combin@@ ation lead to success . 
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about 6 , which have stable structures . 
i tried something exciting . 
i thought , we bring the po@@ ker@@ ein@@ sat@@ z the same . 
so i off@@ ered a $ 10,000 prize to software for the win@@ ners . 
what do you think happened with these design stud@@ ent@@ s@@ ? 
what was the result ? 
that happened here . not a team had a stable structure . 
if anyone had built a 2.@@ 5@@ c@@ m high construction , he would have car@@ ried the price home . 
so is not it interesting that high bet@@ s have a strong effec@@ t@@ ? 
we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same students . 
what do you think happen@@ ed@@ ? 
now they understood the advantage of &quot; prototyp@@ ing &quot; , 
so the same bad team became one of the best . 
they produced the highest construction in the least amount of time . 
there are profound lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success . 
you might as@@ k@@ : why would anyone actually invest time to create a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challen@@ ge@@ ? 
the bottom line is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual effects &quot; to create . 
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is help you identify hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions . 
because frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . 
the challenge is to have a shared experience , a common language or at@@ titude , to build the right prototyp@@ e . 
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise . 
and those of you who are interested can visit %marshmallowchallenge .com . 
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allows . 
there is a ste@@ p-@@ by@@ -@@ step gui@@ de there . 
you will find crazy examples from all over the world how people optimi@@ ze and re@@ fine the system . 
there are also world recor@@ ds . 
and the basic lesson , i think , is that construction is actually a uni@@ fying sport . 
it dem@@ ands that we all direct our sen@@ ses to the task and that we use our thinking opti@@ mal@@ ly , as our emotions and ours do , in the challenge that lies ahead . 
and sometimes a small prototyp@@ e of this experience is all it takes us from a &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; - to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; -@@ moment to bring . 
and that can make a big difference . 
many thanks . 
do we pre@@ tend we have a machine her@@ e@@ , 
a big machine , a cool , ted-@@ like machine , and that &apos;s a time machine . 
and everyone in this room has to go inside . 
and you can go back in time , you can go to the fu@@ tur@@ e@@ ; they can not stay in here and no@@ w@@ , 
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot lat@@ ely , and they all wanted to go back in time . 
i do not know . they wanted to go back in time , before cars or twitter or &quot; ameri@@ ka su@@ cht den super@@ star &quot; , 
i do not know . 
i am convinced that one is somehow attra@@ cted to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , to wis@@ h@@ ful thinking . 
and i understand that . 
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say . 
i do not want to go back in the past , and not because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er - 
it is because possibilities on this planet do not go back , they go forward . 
so i want to get into this machine and i want to go to the future . 
this is the greatest time that has ever exist@@ ed on this planet , no matter what scale you appl@@ y@@ : health , wealth , mobili@@ ty , opportunities , dec@@ reas@@ ing disease rates . 
there has never been a time like this before . 
my %great-grandparents all died when they were 60 years old . 
my grand@@ parents pus@@ hed this number to 70 . 
my parents are 80 on their he@@ els . 
so there should better be a nine at the beginning of my death . 
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that . 
a child born in new del@@ hi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world 100 years ago . 
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact . 
any why is this the case ? 
the small@@ po@@ x . the small@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet . 
they have res@@ ha@@ ped earth &apos;s demo@@ graphi@@ cs in a way that no war ever has . 
they &apos;re gone . they have disappe@@ ared . 
we have de@@ fe@@ ated them . pu@@ ff . 
in the rich world , there are hard@@ ly any diseases that have left millions of us thre@@ ate@@ ned just one generation ago . 
di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia , ru@@ bel@@ la , polio . . . 
does anyone even know what that is@@ ? 
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people - these are the results of the scientific method . 
and , in my view , the scientific method is to try things out , see if it works , change it if it does not , one of man@@ kind &apos;s greatest achie@@ ve@@ ments . 
so that &apos;s the good news . 
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there are a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned frequ@@ ent@@ ly@@ , 
and one of them is that despite all of our achie@@ ve@@ ments , a billion people in this world go to bed hun@@ gry every day . 
that number is ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing very fast , and that &apos;s sha@@ me@@ ful . 
and not only that , we have used our imagination to de@@ vas@@ tate this world tho@@ roughly . 
drin@@ king water , arab@@ le land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas@@ : they are disappe@@ aring , and soon , and if we do not get out of this chaos we will disappe@@ ar too . 
the question is@@ : can we do th@@ at@@ ? i guess so . 
i believe it is clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without ra@@ pe the land they live on . 
i think we can supply this world with energy that does not destro@@ y it at the same time . 
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not wis@@ h@@ ful thinking . 
but this kee@@ ps me a@@ wake at night - one of the things that keep me a@@ wake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific advan@@ ces as much as we &apos;ve ever done , ne@@ ver@@ , 
and we have never been able to use it proper@@ ly , as we can today . 
we are on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many areas . and yet i really think that we would have to go back hundreds of , 300 years before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time in which we have f@@ ought progress , in which we have f@@ ought more viol@@ ently over these things , on more fron@@ ts than now . 
people are wra@@ pped up in their belie@@ fs , so close that they can not be liber@@ ated . 
not even the truth will free her . 
and listen , everyone has a right to his opini@@ on@@ ; even a right to his opini@@ on on pro@@ gre@@ ss@@ , 
but do you know what they are wrong ab@@ out@@ ? 
they have no right to their own facts . &apos;@@ ; sorry , they do not have . 
and it took me a while to figure that out . 
about a decade ago i have an article about vac@@ cin@@ ations for &quot; the new yor@@ ker &quot; written a small article . 
and i was ast@@ oni@@ shed to en@@ coun@@ ter resi@@ stance , to resi@@ sting what in the end is the most effective measure in health care in the history of human@@ kind . 
i did not know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and went on . 
and soon after@@ wards i wrote an article on gene@@ tically modi@@ fied fo@@ ods . 
the same thing , only bigger . 
the people played crazy . 
so i also wrote an article about it , and i could not understand why people thought it was &quot; frank@@ en@@ food &quot; why they believed that moving molecules around in a certain rather than a random way was an invasi@@ on of the real@@ m of nature . 
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i continu@@ ed . 
i mean , i &apos;m a journ@@ ali@@ st@@ , 
we type in , we hand in , we go eat , that &apos;s okay . 
but these artic@@ les worried me , and i could not figure out why , and eventually i found out . 
and that &apos;s because those fan@@ at@@ ics who dro@@ ve me crazy were no fan@@ at@@ ics at all . 
these were pr@@ u@@ dent people , educ@@ ated people , dec@@ ent people . 
they were just like the people in this room . 
and that mess@@ ed me up so much . . . 
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it@@ : 
we have reach@@ ed a point where we do not have the same propor@@ tion to progress as before . 
we talk about it ambi@@ gu@@ ously . 
we speak ir@@ oni@@ cally about it , with small quot@@ es around it@@ : &quot; advan@@ ce &quot; , 
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know which reasons that are . 
we have lost confidence in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there is no reason why this should not be so . 
you can just name a few names and people will understand . 
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vio@@ x@@ x , weapons of mass destruction , the us pres@@ identi@@ al elec@@ tion 2000 . 
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list . 
there are questions and problems with the people we thought were always right . so be skep@@ tical . 
ask questions , ask for evidence , ask for docum@@ ents . 
do not take anything for gran@@ ted . 
but now comes &apos;@@ ; s@@ : if you get evidence , you must accept these evi@@ den@@ ces , and we are not good at that . 
and i can say that , right now , we &apos;re living in an epidemic of fear that i &apos;ve never seen before and hopefully will never see again . 
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that lin@@ ked the autis@@ m epidemic to meas@@ les , mu@@ mp@@ s , and ru@@ bel@@ la vac@@ cin@@ e . 
very sc@@ ary . 
hea@@ ps of studies were done to see if that was true . 
hea@@ ps of studies should be car@@ ried out@@ ; that is a serious matter . 
the data came in . 
the data came in from the us , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no connection , none at all . 
it makes no difference . it makes no difference because we believe in an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes , believe what we see , what we believe we see , what makes us feel real . 
we do not believe in a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government offi@@ cial giving us data , and i understand that , i think we all do . 
but do you know what@@ ? 
the result of that was cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c@@ , 
cat@@ astro@@ phic because of this fac@@ t@@ : the usa is one of the only countries in the world where the imp@@ rin@@ ts for meas@@ les dec@@ line . 
that is scan@@ da@@ lou@@ s and we should be ash@@ amed . 
it is terrible . 
what happened that we could do that . 
well , i understand that . i do . 
because someone has her@@ e@@ ? 
has anyone in the audience ever seen anyone die of meas@@ les@@ ? 
does not happen very often . 
it does not happen in this country at all , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year . 
these are many dea@@ ths by mol@@ ders , 20 per hour . 
but because that has not happened here , we can repres@@ s it , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can run around pre@@ ach@@ ing mess@@ ages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king live . 
and they can do that because they do not connect cause and cor@@ relation . 
they do not understand that these things seem the same but almost never the same . 
and that &apos;s something we have to learn , and very fast . 
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k . 
he free@@ d us from one of the worst sc@@ our@@ ges of humanity . 
no fear , no tor@@ ments , pal@@ sy , pu@@ ff , disappe@@ ared . 
the guy in the middle not so much . 
his name is paul offi@@ t . 
he has just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus vac@@ cin@@ e with a few other people . 
it can save the lives of 40@@ 0-@@ 50@@ 0,000 children per year in developing countries . 
pretty good , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
well , that &apos;s good , apart from the fact that paul wal@@ ks around and talks about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how valuable they are and that people should stop comp@@ la@@ ining . 
and he actually says so . 
so paul is a terrori@@ st . 
when paul speak@@ s at a public hearing , he can not te@@ stif@@ y without arm@@ ed guar@@ ds . 
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school . 
and why ? because paul made a vac@@ cin@@ e . 
i do not need to say that , but vac@@ cin@@ es are indi@@ spen@@ sa@@ ble . 
if you take them away , the diseases return , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s just happening . 
we have been working in this country now . 
and that is going to get worse , and pretty soon kids will die again because that &apos;s just a matter of numbers . 
and you will not just die from the fi@@ bers . 
what about poli@@ o@@ ? let &apos;s take that . why not ? 
a fellow student of mine wrote to me a few weeks ago and said she thinks i &apos;m a bit too sh@@ ri@@ ll . 
nobody ever said that before . 
she would not vac@@ cin@@ ate her child against polio . no way . 
fine . 
why ? because we have no polio . and you know what@@ ? 
yesterday we had no polio in this country . 
today , i do not know , maybe this morning somebody got on a plane in la@@ gos and is flying to los angeles , at the moment he is over o@@ hi@@ o . 
and in a few hours he lands and ren@@ ts a car , and he comes to long beach , and he will atten@@ d one of these fantastic ted-@@ dinner ton@@ ight . 
and he does not know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a cri@@ pp@@ ling disease , and we do not know that , because that &apos;s the way the world works . 
that &apos;s the planet we live on . do not pre@@ tend that he is not . 
we love to lie in lies . we love that . 
did you take all your vi@@ tam@@ ins this mor@@ nin@@ g@@ ? 
ech@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a small anti@@ ox@@ i@@ dan@@ t that helps you to get started . 
i know they did that because half of americans do it every day . 
they take the stuff , and they take alternative reme@@ dies , and it makes no difference how often we find out that they are use@@ less . 
the data shows that constantly . 
they dar@@ ken their ur@@ ine . they almost never do more . 
that &apos;s okay , they want to pay $ 28 billion for dark ur@@ ine . 
i totally agree with them . 
dark ur@@ ine . dark . 
why do we do th@@ at@@ ? why do we do th@@ at@@ ? 
well , i think i understand - we hate the phar@@ ma industry . 
we hate too strong a government . we have no confidence in the system . 
and we should not . our health system is lou@@ sy . 
it is cru@@ el to millions of people . 
it is absolutely ama@@ z@@ ingly cold and sou@@ l-@@ destro@@ ying even to us who can afford it . 
so we run away from it and where are we go@@ ing@@ ? 
we are running into the arms of the plac@@ e@@ bo industry . 
that &apos;s great . i love the plac@@ e@@ bo industry . 
but you know , this is really a serious matter , because the stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars on it . 
and i have all sorts of little prop@@ s here . 
none of them - g@@ ing@@ ko , fra@@ u@@ d , ech@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fra@@ u@@ d , ac@@ ai , i do not even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars on it , it &apos;s fra@@ u@@ d . 
and you know what@@ ? when i say that , people yel@@ l at me and say , &quot; what do you care about , let people do what they want . 
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot; 
and you know what@@ ? you are wrong . 
because i do not care if it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; hm@@ m , i will not accept the evidence from my experts on mammo@@ graph@@ y &quot; or any cancer qua@@ ck who wants to treat his patient with coffee ene@@ mas . 
when you go on this journey , where faith and magic replace evidence and science , you come to a place where you do not want to be . 
you arri@@ ve at th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa . 
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of his people because he insi@@ sted that bee@@ tro@@ ot , gar@@ lic and le@@ mon oil are much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medic@@ ines , which we know can help slow aids . 
hundreds of thousands of un@@ necessary dea@@ ths in a country pla@@ gu@@ ed worse than any other disease . 
please do not tell me that these things have no consequences . 
they have them . they always have . 
well , the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ gling epidemic we &apos;re in right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d struggle between the ad@@ vo@@ cat@@ es of gene@@ tically modi@@ fied fo@@ ods and the bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te . 
this is an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . she has to stop . 
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors . 
that &apos;s ide@@ ology , not science . 
everything we eat , every gra@@ in of ri@@ ce , every twi@@ g of par@@ sle@@ y , every bru@@ ss@@ el spr@@ out@@ s , has been changed by the people . 
you know , there were no tan@@ geri@@ nes in para@@ dis@@ e . 
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe mel@@ ons . 
there were no christ@@ mas trees . we did it all . 
we did it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years . 
and some of it worked and some did not . 
we got rid of what did not work . 
now we can do it more accu@@ rat@@ ely . and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a ri@@ ce , and the stuff can help millions of people to exten@@ d their lives to millions . 
you do not want to do th@@ at@@ ? 
i have to say , i do not understand that . 
we re@@ je@@ ct gene@@ tically modi@@ fied food . 
why do we do th@@ at@@ ? 
well , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is@@ : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we do not want huge fields with a thing , that &apos;s wrong . 
we do not want to patent company life . 
we do not want to own company see@@ ds . 
and do you know what my answer to all this is@@ ? 
yes , you are right . we fix that . 
yes , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science . 
that has nothing to do with science . 
it &apos;s right , moral@@ e , patent stuff . 
you know that science is not a company . 
she is not a country . 
she is not even an ide@@ a@@ ; it is a process . 
it is a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its work because we are afraid is a real dead end , and it kee@@ ps millions of people from blo@@ om@@ ing . 
you know , over the next 50 years , we &apos;ll have to grow 70 percent more food than we do now . 70 percent . 
this investment in africa over the last 30 years . 
sha@@ me@@ ful . sha@@ me@@ ful . 
they need that , and we do not give it to them . 
and why ? gene@@ tically modi@@ fied food . 
we do not want to encourage people to eat this ro@@ tten stuff , like mani@@ o@@ c . 
cas@@ sav@@ a is something that half a billion people eat . 
it &apos;s like a po@@ tat@@ o . 
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it is lou@@ sy . 
it has no nutri@@ ents , it has no protein , and scientists are in@@ corpo@@ rat@@ ing all of this into it . 
and then people could eat that and would not go blind . 
they would not star@@ ve , and they know what@@ ? 
that would be great . it would not be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice . 
and all i can say is , why are we fighting thi@@ s@@ ? 
i mean , we ask our@@ sel@@ ves@@ : why are we fighting thi@@ s@@ ? 
because we do not want to sho@@ ve genes aro@@ und@@ ? 
it &apos;s not about pus@@ hing genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals . 
it &apos;s not about our ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our insi@@ sten@@ ce on bigger food , better food , unique food . 
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce kri@@ spie@@ s , it &apos;s about keeping people alive and it &apos;s high time to understand what that means . 
because you know some@@ thin@@ g@@ ? 
if we do not do that , if we go on doing what we are doing , we ow@@ e ourselves to something that i do not think we ow@@ e , high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism . 
there is no other descri@@ ption for what happens here . 
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s not wor@@ thy of us , and we really have to stop it . 
so , after this unbe@@ lie@@ va@@ bly funny conversation , you may want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into that ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous time machine and into the fu@@ tur@@ e@@ ? &quot; 
in any case . i want that in any case . 
at the moment she is in the present , but we have an incredible possibility . 
we can put this time machine on everything we want . 
we can move them where we want to move them , and we will move them where we want to go . 
we have to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we have to think , but if we get into the time machine and go into the future we will be gla@@ d to have done that . 
i know we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
for some time now i am interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect . it may seem od@@ d that an mag@@ ic@@ ian is interested in it , unless you consider it as i do , as &quot; a del@@ usi@@ on that becomes something real if someone just belie@@ ves stron@@ gl@@ y enough . &quot; 
in other words , sugar pil@@ ls have had a measu@@ rab@@ le effect in some studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what &apos;s happening to them is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or a kind of . . . in pain management , for example , if the patient belie@@ ves only stron@@ gl@@ y enough , there is a measu@@ rab@@ le effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect . 
a del@@ usi@@ on becomes something real because someone percei@@ ves it that way . 
so that we can understand each other , i would like to show you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
and i will show you how it works . this is a trick that has been in every children &apos;s magic book at least since the 195@@ 0s . 
i myself learned it from the sc@@ out magic sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s . 
i will ex@@ ecu@@ te it for you and then explain it . 
and then i will explain why i explain it . 
so , see what happens . 
the kni@@ fe that you can exam@@ ine@@ ; my hand that you can exam@@ ine . 
i will just hold the kni@@ fe in my fis@@ t . 
i push my sle@@ ev@@ e back . 
and to make sure nothing disappe@@ ars or gets out of my sle@@ ev@@ e , i &apos;ll just squ@@ ee@@ ze my wri@@ st right here . 
in this way you can see that at no time does anything move . as long as i press here , nothing can wand@@ er in my sle@@ ev@@ e or come out . 
and the goal is quite simple . 
i will open my hand , and hopefully , if all goes well , the kni@@ fe will be held by my mer@@ e physical magne@@ tis@@ m . 
it actually si@@ ts so ti@@ ghtly in its place that i can sha@@ ke it without dro@@ pping the kni@@ fe . 
nothing wander@@ ing in my sle@@ ev@@ e or coming out , no tri@@ cker@@ y . and they can investi@@ gate everything . 
ta@@ -@@ da@@ ! 
well , this is a trick i often teach little children who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception if you look closer , although it is a very easy trick to do . 
probably many of you know this trick here in the room . 
it works like thi@@ s@@ : 
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand . 
i say i en@@ close my wri@@ st to make sure nothing in my sle@@ ev@@ e disappe@@ ars or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie . 
the reason why i hold my wri@@ st is that it is the real secret of illusion . 
for in the moment when i turn my hand away from them to see them from behind , that finger here , my inde@@ x finger , moves from where it was to a position where it is so stre@@ t@@ ched out . 
great tri@@ ck@@ ? 
there is someone sitting behind who did not have childhood . 
so , he is here . i agree . 
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position . 
and now one could talk about why this is a del@@ usi@@ on , why one does not realize that there are only three finger@@ s down her@@ e@@ : because the mind and the way it processes information does not count them one by one , one , two , three but sees you as a group . 
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s all about now . and then i open my hand . 
of course , it is held there , but not by the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but by a trick , by my inde@@ x finger , which is now there . 
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens , as i turn back , hidden by this movement , that the finger moves back again . 
i take this hand away . and here is the kni@@ fe . 
you can show this trick to your friends and neighbor@@ s . thank you . 
now , what does this have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effec@@ t@@ ? 
a year or so ago , i read a study that really ble@@ w me away . 
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , so that was an amazing thing for me . 
it turns out that if you offer a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white pil@@ l , in the form of an as@@ pir@@ in tab@@ let , it is simply a round , white pil@@ l that has a certain measu@@ rab@@ le effect . 
but if you change the form in which you plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , into a smaller pil@@ l , and color it blue and letter it , it is actually measu@@ rab@@ ly more effective . 
and that , though none of it is any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical . . . it &apos;s just sugar pil@@ ls . 
but a white pil@@ l is not as good as a blue pil@@ l . 
what ? that really made me fre@@ ak out . 
but it turned out that that &apos;s not all . 
if you take cap@@ su@@ les , they are even more effective than tab@@ lets of any form . 
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le that is yellow at one end and red at the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le . 
do@@ sing also plays a role . 
one pil@@ l twice a day is not as good as three pil@@ ls - i can not remember the exac@@ t statistics now . i &apos;m sorry . 
the key , though , is . . . 
. . . that the do@@ sages also play a role . 
and shape plays a role . 
and if you want the ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you have to res@@ ort to the need@@ le . 
cor@@ rect ? an in@@ effective sy@@ ring@@ e - a few milli@@ liter@@ s of in@@ effective substan@@ ce inje@@ cted into a patient . 
this creates a very strong image in the head . this is much stron@@ ger than a white pil@@ l . 
this art@@ work is really . . . i &apos;ll show you another time if we have a proje@@ ctor . 
the fact is that the white pil@@ l does not work as well as the blue pil@@ l , which does not work as well as a cap@@ su@@ le , which does not work as well as the need@@ le . 
and none of that has any real pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical properties . it is only our belief in it that makes us stron@@ ger . 
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick . 
i take something that is obviously a del@@ usi@@ on , and make it look real . 
we know from that study that you have to res@@ ort to the need@@ le , if it should go to the point . 
this is a 18 c@@ m long hat pi@@ n . she is very , very poin@@ ted . and i will first ster@@ ili@@ ze it a little bit . 
this is really my meat . it is not dam@@ ian &apos;s special bre@@ d meat . 
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood . 
i will now pie@@ r@@ ce this need@@ le in my skin and drive through it until it exi@@ ts on the other side again . 
if they get sick - if they fa@@ int easily - i showed this to some friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i did not know , and a woman almost fa@@ inte@@ d . 
so i suggest if you get sick quickly then look away for the next 30 seconds . or , you know what , i &apos;ll do the first tri@@ cky part here . 
they can see it soon , but they can also look the other way if they want . 
so , it goes on , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;ll just make a small stab . 
i &apos;m really sorry . is she doing that cra@@ zy@@ ? 
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side so out again . 
now we are actually in the same situation that we had at the kni@@ fe trick . 
appro@@ xi@@ mat@@ ely . 
but now you can not count my finger@@ s , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
so , i will show you them . that &apos;s one , two , three , four , five . 
oh well , 
i know what people think when they see that . 
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and pie@@ r@@ cing your skin just to keep us enter@@ tain@@ ed for a few minutes . &quot; 
well , then i &apos;ll show you . 
how does this look lik@@ e@@ ? pretty good . 
yes i know . 
and the people behind say , &quot; okay , i did not see it right . &quot; 
the people in the side rooms come in now . 
let me show you up close . 
that &apos;s really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood . 
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn it around . 
i &apos;m sorry . if they get sick , they look away , do not look . 
the people behind or those who see this later on video , will say , &quot; well , that looks pretty impres@@ sive , but if it were real , he would - see , here is a hole and there , if it really would be , it would ble@@ ed . &quot; 
okay , let me squ@@ ee@@ ze some blood out for you . 
yes , here it is . 
normally , i would now take out the need@@ le . 
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no sor@@ es . 
but i think , in this context , here and with the inten@@ tion to turn a del@@ usi@@ on into something real , i will just leave the need@@ le in there and go off stage . 
we will meet a few times in the next days . 
i hope you are looking forward to it . many thanks . 
everyone is talking about happiness these days . 
i have some people count the number of books that are lab@@ ele@@ d &quot; happiness &quot; have been published in the ti@@ tle over the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more . 
there is a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers . 
there is a lot of lu@@ ck co@@ ach@@ ing . 
everyone would like to make people happ@@ ier . 
but despite all this tor@@ ren@@ t of work , there are several cognitive tra@@ ps that make it almost impossible to think clearly about happiness . 
and my talk today will main@@ ly be about these cognitive tra@@ ps . 
this is true for lay people who think about their own happiness , and it appli@@ es to scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we are just as conf@@ used as anyone else . 
the first of these falls is a rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance to ad@@ mit complexity . 
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word because we apply it to too many different things . 
i think there is a defini@@ te meaning to which we could lim@@ it it , but by and large it is something we have to give up , and we will have to take the complicated view of what is well@@ being . 
the second tra@@ p is a con@@ fusion of experience and memor@@ y@@ : basically , she is between being happy in his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life . 
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they are both thro@@ wn together in the idea of ​​happiness . 
and the third is the concent@@ ration illusion , and that is the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can not think about a circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without dist@@ or@@ ting its meaning . 
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive tra@@ p . 
there &apos;s just no way to get it right . 
now i would like to start with an example from someone who had a question and answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures that told a story . indistinctly . . . he said he had heard a symp@@ hon@@ y , and it was absolutely mag@@ nifi@@ cent music , and at the very end of the recor@@ ding there was a terrible scre@@ ech@@ ing sound . 
and then he add@@ ed , really emotional , that ru@@ ined the whole experience . 
but that did not happen . 
what it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experience . 
he had the experience . 
he had had 20 minutes of wonderful music . 
they did not count because he rema@@ ined with a memor@@ y@@ ; the memory was ru@@ ined and the memory was all he had to keep . 
what this really means to us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two kinds of self . 
there is an experi@@ en@@ cer himself who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of reli@@ ving the past , but basically has only the present . 
it is the experi@@ en@@ cing itself that appe@@ als to the doctor - you know when the doctor as@@ k@@ s@@ : &quot; does it hurt now if i touch her her@@ e@@ ? &quot; 
and then there is a remin@@ ding itself , and the remin@@ ding itself is that which coun@@ ts and up@@ holds the story of our lives , and it is the one that appe@@ als to the physi@@ cian by asking the questi@@ on@@ : &quot; how have you felt lat@@ ely ? &quot; 
or &quot; how was your trip to al@@ ban@@ i@@ a@@ ? &quot; or something like that . 
these are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and to conf@@ use the two is part of the con@@ fusion of the concept of happiness . 
well , the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing itself is a story tel@@ ler . 
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memor@@ ies - it starts right away . 
we do not just tell stories when we set out to tell stories . 
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we are allowed to keep from our experiences is a story . 
and let &apos;s not start with an example . 
there is an old study . 
these are real patients who under@@ go a pain@@ ful proce@@ dur@@ e . 
i will not go into detail . it is not pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was done in the 199@@ 0s . 
they were asked to report their pain every 60 seconds . 
and here are two patients . these are your recor@@ ds . 
and they are asked , &quot; which of them has suff@@ ered more ? &quot; 
and that is a very simple question . 
patient b has clearly suff@@ ered more . his col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y was longer , and every minute of pain that patient had a had patient b , and more . 
but now there is another questi@@ on@@ : &quot; how much did these patients think they were suff@@ er@@ ing@@ ? &quot; 
and here is a surpris@@ e@@ : 
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse remin@@ der of col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y than patient b . 
the stories of the bow@@ els were different and because a very cru@@ cial part of the story is how it ends - 
and none of these stories is very edi@@ fying or great - but one of them is this clearly . . . 
but one of them is signific@@ antly worse than the other . 
and the one worse is where the pain was at its very high end . it &apos;s a bad story . 
how do we know thi@@ s@@ ? 
because we asked these people for their bow@@ els , and also much lat@@ er@@ : &quot; how bad was the whole thing in gener@@ al@@ ? &quot; . 
and she was far worse for a than for b in the re@@ colle@@ ction . 
well , that &apos;s a direct conflict between the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self . 
from the perspective of the experi@@ en@@ cer himself , b clearly had a worse time . 
well , what you could do with patient a , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually exten@@ d the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y of patient a by simply let@@ ting the tube in without too much of it sha@@ ke . 
this will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but only a little and much less than before . 
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , it has the effect that the patient himself is worse off , and the remin@@ ding himself of patient a is much better off , because now patient a has a better story given his experience . 
what makes a story differ@@ ent@@ ? 
and that appli@@ es to the stories that memory provi@@ des us , and it also appli@@ es to the stories we inven@@ t . 
what makes a story stand out are up@@ hea@@ val@@ s , significant moments and ends . 
end@@ ings are very , very important and in this case the end domin@@ ated . 
now , the experi@@ en@@ cer himself lives his life continu@@ ously . 
it has moments of experience , one after the other . 
and you as@@ k@@ : what happens to those moment@@ s@@ ? 
and the answer is really simple . they are lost forever . 
i mean , most of the moments of our lives - and i figured that out - you know , the psych@@ ological present is about three seconds long . which means you know that in one lifetime there are about 600 million of them . in one month there are about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 . most of them leave no tra@@ ce . 
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by remin@@ ding themselves . 
and yet somehow they get the impres@@ sion that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life . 
it is the limited resource that we consum@@ e while we are in this world . 
and how we consum@@ e them would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that re@@ members even for us . 
so we have the self reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing and the experi@@ en@@ cing ourselves , and they are really quite different . 
the biggest difference between them is how to deal with time . 
from the perspective of the experi@@ en@@ cer himself , if you have a hol@@ i@@ day and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week hol@@ i@@ day is twice as good as the one-@@ week hol@@ i@@ day . 
this does not work at all for the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self . 
for the remin@@ ding itself , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is hard@@ ly better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new memor@@ ies add@@ ed . 
they did not change the story . 
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that distin@@ gui@@ she@@ s a reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ en@@ cing self . time has very little influence on this story . 
well , the remin@@ ding itself does more than remember and tell stories . 
it is actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , say , had two bow@@ el refle@@ xes at two different surge@@ ons and deci@@ des which one to choose , then the one who choo@@ ses who has the memory is the one who choo@@ ses less bad and that is the surgeon who will be sele@@ cted . 
the experi@@ en@@ cer himself has no voice in this choice . 
actually , we do not choose between experiences . we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences . 
and even when we think about the future , we do not usually think of our future as an experience . 
we think about our future as fore@@ seen memor@@ ies . 
and basically , they can look at that , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and they can think of the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self as one that , as it were , dra@@ gs the experi@@ en@@ cing itself through experiences that the experi@@ en@@ cer himself does not need . 
i have the impres@@ sion that when we go on vac@@ ation that is very often the case , that is , we make hol@@ i@@ days as much as possible in the service of remin@@ ding ourselves . 
and that &apos;s a bit hard to justi@@ fy , i think . 
i mean , how much do we draw from our memor@@ ie@@ s@@ ? 
this is one of the explan@@ ations given for the domin@@ ance of the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self . 
and when i think about it , i think of a hol@@ i@@ day we did a couple of years ago in the ant@@ arc@@ tic , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think about it a lot in propor@@ tion to how many times i spend think about other hol@@ i@@ days . 
and i &apos;ve probably consum@@ ed my memor@@ ies of this three-@@ week trip , i &apos;d say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years . 
well , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 images in it i would have spent another hour . 
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s a ma@@ xi@@ mu@@ m of one and a half hours . 
there seems to be a disc@@ re@@ pan@@ cy . 
well , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have for the memory of memor@@ ies , but even if you do more , there is a real question . why do we give memor@@ ies so much weight in compar@@ ison to the weight that we give experi@@ en@@ ce@@ s@@ ? 
so i want you to think about a thought experiment . 
imagine your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of your vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed and you will get an am@@ nes@@ tic drug so that you will not remember anything . 
well , would you choose the same vac@@ a@@ tion@@ ? 
and if they choose another vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between their two kinds of self and they have to think about how they decide that conflict and that really is not obvious at all , because if you think in terms of time they get an answer , and if you think in the sense of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer . 
why we choose the vac@@ ation that we choose is a problem that pres@@ ents itself with a choice between the two types of self . 
well , the two kinds of self raise two no@@ tions of happiness . 
there are actually two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one per self . 
so you can as@@ k@@ : how happy is the experi@@ en@@ cer him@@ sel@@ f@@ ? 
and then you would as@@ k@@ : how happy are the moments in the life of the experi@@ en@@ cer him@@ sel@@ f@@ ? 
and they are all - happiness for a moment is a rather complicated process . 
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red@@ ? 
and , by the way , we are now able to get a pretty good idea of ​​the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cer himself over time . 
if you ask for the happiness of reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing yourself , it is a very different matter . 
this is not about how happy a person lives . 
it &apos;s about how satis@@ fied or pleas@@ ed the person is when that person thinks about their lives . 
very different concept . 
anyone who does not distin@@ gui@@ sh these concep@@ ts will scre@@ w up the exploration of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a multi@@ tude of researchers of well-@@ being who have long mess@@ ed up the exploration of happiness in just that way . 
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cer himself and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in recent years , and now ef@@ fort@@ s are being made to measure them separ@@ ately . 
the gall@@ up organization has conduc@@ ted a worldwide survey asking over half a million people about what they think about their lives and their experiences . and there were other ef@@ fort@@ s in the direction . 
in recent years , we have be@@ gun to learn about the good fortun@@ e of the two kinds of self . 
and the main lesson we have learned , i think , is that they are really different . 
they know how satis@@ fied someone is with their lives , and that really does not teach them much about how happy he is to live his life and vice ver@@ sa . 
just to give you an idea of ​​the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 . 
what that means is that if you were to meet someone and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about his si@@ ze@@ ? 
well , you would know something about its size , but there is a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty . 
you have so much un@@ certain@@ ty . 
when i tell you that someone has classi@@ fied his life as eight on a scale of ten , you have much un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy he is with his experi@@ en@@ cing himself . 
the cor@@ relation is therefore low . 
we know something about what determin@@ es the satis@@ fac@@ tion of happ@@ ine@@ ss@@ -@@ self . 
we know that money is very important , goals are very important . 
we know that happiness is main@@ ly about being happy with people we like , spending time with people we like . 
there are other pleas@@ ures , but that is domin@@ ant . 
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two kinds of self , you will end up doing very different things . 
the conclu@@ sion from what i said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stit@@ ute for well-@@ being . 
it is a completely different concept . 
well , very brie@@ fly , another reason we can not clearly think about happiness is that we do not pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live . 
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , they will not get the right answer . 
when you ask that question , you think people in california need to be happ@@ ier when they live , say , o@@ hi@@ o . 
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , let &apos;s say , climate . 
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ en@@ cer himself , and it is not even very important to the thou@@ ght@@ ful self that deci@@ des how happy people are . 
but now , because the thou@@ ght@@ ful self is responsible , they may end up - some people might end up moving to california . 
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to see what happens to people who move to california hop@@ ing to become happ@@ ier . 
well , you living yourself will not be happ@@ ier . 
we know that . 
but a thing will happen . they will think they are happ@@ ier , because when they think about it , they will be remin@@ ded of how terrible the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o . and you will feel that you have made the right decision . 
it is very difficult to think clearly about well-@@ being , and i hope i have given you an idea of ​​how difficult it is . 
thank you . 
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you . 
many thanks . 
well , when we tele@@ pho@@ ned a few weeks ago they mentioned to me that there was a pretty interesting result from this gall@@ up pol@@ l . 
is that something you can share with us because you have a few minutes le@@ ft@@ ? 
dan@@ iel ka@@ hn@@ em@@ an@@ : sure . 
i think the most interesting result we found in the gall@@ up survey is a number that we absolutely did not expect to find . 
we found this in view of the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cer himself . 
when we looked at how feelings var@@ y with income . 
and it turns out that under an income of $ 6@@ 0,000 a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sam@@ ple of americans , about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 , but it &apos;s a large repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple , with an income of $ 6@@ 00@@ ,000 a year 
6@@ 0,000 . 
d@@ k@@ : 6@@ 0,000 . 
$ 6@@ 0,000 a year makes people un@@ happy , and they get increasingly un@@ happy the poor@@ er they become . 
above that we get an absolutely flat line . 
i mean , i have ra@@ rely seen such flat lines . 
what happens is obvious , that money does not give you any experi@@ en@@ ce-@@ lu@@ ck , but that a lack of money will certainly make you mis@@ er@@ able , and we can measure that mis@@ ery very , very clearly . 
in the sense of the other self , of the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , you get another story . 
the more money you ear@@ n , the happ@@ ier you are . 
that does not apply to emotions . 
but dan@@ ny , throughout the american effort is about life , freedom , the pur@@ suit of bli@@ ss . 
if people were serious about that , i mean , it seems to turn everything up@@ side down , everything we believe , for example , in terms of ta@@ x policy and so on . 
is there any chance that politicians would generally take a decision on how to take the policy seriously and make policy based on it@@ ? 
d@@ k@@ : you know , i believe that there is recogni@@ tion for the role of happiness research in politics . 
the recogni@@ tion will be slow in the united states , no question , but in the united king@@ dom it is happening right now and is happening in other countries . 
people are recogni@@ zing that they should think of lu@@ ck when they think of politics . 
it will be a while , and people will be discus@@ sing whether they want to explore experi@@ enti@@ al happiness or whether they want to explore life@@ -@@ asse@@ ss@@ ment , so we need to lead this discussion pretty soon . 
how one can increase happiness depen@@ ds very much on how they think and whether they think of the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self or whether they think about the experi@@ en@@ cer himself . 
that will affect politics , i think , in the coming years . 
in the united states , people are trying to measure the happiness of the people . 
i think that will be part of national statistics for the next year or two . 
well , it seems to me , this top@@ ic is , or at least should be , the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years . 
thank you for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics . 
thanks , dan@@ ny ka@@ hn@@ em@@ an . 
i am jan@@ e mc@@ gi@@ gi@@ ga@@ l . i design computer games . 
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now . and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in the real world as it is to save in online games . 
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including them all , to spend more time playing bigger and better games . 
we currently spend 3 billion hours a week playing online games . 
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot; 
maybe a little too much time , consi@@ der@@ ing how many issues we ur@@ gent@@ ly need to solve in the real world . 
in fact , according to my research at the institute for the future , exactly the opposite is true . 
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most pres@@ sing problems . 
in fact , i am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dra@@ matically increase that time . 
i calcul@@ ated that the requi@@ red time is 21 billion hours of play per week . 
this may seem a little out@@ land@@ ish at first , so i &apos;ll repe@@ at it for it to work@@ : if we want to solve problems such as hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and ob@@ es@@ ity , i think we must try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to play until the end of the next decade . 
no , i &apos;m really serious . 
why ? this picture pretty much descri@@ bes why i believe that games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . seriously . 
this is a portra@@ it of the photograph@@ er phi@@ l tol@@ ed@@ an@@ o . 
he wanted to capture the emotions while playing . so he built a camera in front of the players . 
this is one of the classi@@ c expres@@ sions when playing . 
if you are not a player you may miss some of the nu@@ ance@@ s in this picture . 
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , some an@@ x@@ iety , but also extreme concent@@ ration , completely en@@ gross@@ ed in solving a really difficult problem . 
if you play , you will see some nu@@ ance@@ s here , the eyes are dra@@ wn up and the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m . the e@@ ye@@ brow@@ s show surprise . 
this is a player who is on the br@@ ink of a so-@@ called epi@@ c vic@@ tory . 
oh , you know that . ok . fine . so we have some players here . 
an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is a result that is so over@@ whe@@ l@@ m@@ ingly positive that they did not even know it was possible . 
it was almost beyond imagination . 
and when they reach it , they are sho@@ cked that they are actually capable of doing so . this is an epi@@ c vic@@ tory . 
this player is about to win an epi@@ c vic@@ tory . 
and this is what we must see on the millions of faces of problem sol@@ vers around the world as we tac@@ kle the next century hur@@ d@@ les . the face of those who are on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory against all od@@ ds . 
well , unfortunately , we tend to see this face in real life when we en@@ coun@@ ter difficult problems . 
i call it the &quot; in life i am bad &quot; -@@ face . and it &apos;s actually my face , you see@@ ? yes ? ok . 
that &apos;s me , like me , &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; make face . 
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home in ber@@ kel@@ ey , california , where in my doc@@ tor@@ al thesis i studied why we are better at playing than in real life . 
this is a problem that many players have . 
we think that in reality we are not as good as in games . 
and i do not just mean less successful , though that &apos;s part of it . 
we reach more in game world@@ s . i think it &apos;s good to be motiv@@ ated to do something meaning@@ ful and to work together . 
when we are in a game world , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version , always ready to help , pers@@ is@@ tent@@ ly trying to solve the problem as long as necessary , trying again after the failure . 
and in reality , when we fail , when we en@@ coun@@ ter obs@@ tac@@ les , we often feel different . 
we feel over@@ whe@@ l@@ med . we feel de@@ fe@@ ated . we feel thre@@ ate@@ ned , perhaps depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal . 
we never have these feelings when we play games , in games they just do not exist . 
and that &apos;s what i wanted to investi@@ gate as a doc@@ tor@@ al student . 
why is it impossible to think in games that one could not achieve every@@ thin@@ g@@ ? 
how can we trans@@ fer these emotions from the games to reali@@ ty@@ ? 
so i watched games like world of war@@ craft , which provi@@ des the ide@@ al environment for collabor@@ ative problem solving . 
and i &apos;ve found some things that make epi@@ c vic@@ tor@@ ies in online world@@ s possible . 
so , first , when you get into one of these online games , especially at world of war@@ craft , there are a lot of different characters who are ready to en@@ trust you with a world@@ -@@ saving mission , right now . 
but not just any mission , but a mission that fit@@ s perfectly to your current level in the game , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
so they do it . 
they never get a task they can not solve . 
but always on the edge of their abilities , so they have to make an effort . but there is no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in world of war@@ craft . 
you do not sit around and turn around . there is always something very important to do . 
and there are tons of employees . 
where@@ ver they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to complete their epi@@ c mission . 
we have in real life not so easy , this feeling that in a finger sna@@ p hea@@ ps of employees ready . 
there is also this epi@@ c story , this inspi@@ ring story , why we are here and what we have to do . 
then we get all this positive feedback . 
they are definitely of &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; heard or &quot; + 1 intelligence &quot; , 
this const@@ ant feedback does not exist in real life . 
when i leave this stage , i do not ha@@ ve@@ : + 1 talk and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea . 
i do not get this feedback in real life . 
so , the problem with online collaboration world@@ s such as world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be at the edge of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory at all times that we &apos;d rather spend all our time in these game world@@ s . 
they are simply better than the reality . 
to date , all world of war@@ craft players have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years together solving the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ oth . 
that is not necessarily something bad . 
it may sound bad . 
but to put it in con@@ text@@ : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago our first pri@@ mate ance@@ stors began to walk up@@ right . 
the first up@@ right pri@@ mate , then . 
okay , so when we talk about how much time we spend playing with at the moment , it only makes sense to look at the time in terms of the mag@@ ni@@ tude of human development , which is extraordinary . 
but also appropriate . because it turns out that by spending all this time on playing , we are actually changing what we humans are capable of doing . 
we develop into commun@@ ally thinking , cor@@ di@@ al beings . 
that &apos;s the truth . i believe in that . 
take a look at this intri@@ gu@@ ing statisti@@ c , recently published by a resear@@ cher from car@@ ne@@ gie mel@@ lo@@ n universi@@ ty@@ : today &apos;s average young man in a country with a strong culture of gam@@ ing spen@@ ds 10,000 hours playing online until the age of 21 . 
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , for 2 reas@@ on@@ s@@ : 
first of all , for children in the united states , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the exac@@ t total time they spend in school , from grade 5 to high school gradu@@ ation - if you never fail . 
so here we have a complete par@@ alle@@ l path@@ way where young people learn just as well , what it means to be a good player , like everything else they learn in school . 
and maybe some of them have the new book by mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; über@@ fli@@ eg@@ er &quot; , read . 
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours . 
it is based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10@@ .000 hours with labor@@ i@@ ous study of any subject up to the 21@@ st year of age , we will master in it . 
we will be as good at doing whatever we can as the most important people in the world . 
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master players . 
the big question is@@ : &quot; what exactly are players mas@@ ter@@ fully good at@@ ? &quot; 
because if we could find that out , we would have virtu@@ ally never had any human potential . 
we currently have so many people in the world who spend at least one hour a day playing online games . 
these are our master players . 500 million people who are exc@@ ep@@ tion@@ ally good at &quot; something &quot; are . 
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are exc@@ ep@@ tion@@ ally good in whatever . 
if you have not heard it ye@@ t@@ , 
the games industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that save energy and work on mobile networks , rather than the broad@@ band internet , so that players around the world can play online , especially in india , china , brazil . 
one expec@@ ts an addi@@ tional billion players in the next decades . 
we have a total of 1.@@ 5 billion players . 
so i started to consider what it is , in which we make these games master . 
here are the 4 things i found . fir@@ st@@ : ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m . 
ok , imagine this as extreme self-@@ motivation . 
sent@@ i@@ mental optimis@@ m requires the desire to do something immediately , to over@@ come a hur@@ d@@ le , along with the belief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of succe@@ eding . 
players always believe that an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is possible , and that it &apos;s always wor@@ th@@ while to try it , right away . 
players do not sit around . 
players are mas@@ ters at spin@@ ning den@@ se social networks . 
there are a lot of interesting resear@@ ches that show that we like people more after we play with them , even if they de@@ fe@@ ated us ba@@ dly . 
the reason for this is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone . 
we trust that someone will spend time with us , that the rules will be respe@@ cted , that we have the same goal and will stick to it until the end of the game . 
so playing together allows the growing of bon@@ ds , trust and each other . 
as a result , we build stron@@ ger social relationships . 
bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity . fantastic ! 
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average world of war@@ craft player plays 22 hours a week , sort of as a part time job . 
the reason is that when we play , we are actually happ@@ ier working hard than rela@@ x@@ ing or doing nothing . 
we know that we as human beings function opti@@ mal@@ ly when doing hard , significant work . 
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the job done . 
and finally , epi@@ c meaning . 
players love to become part of aw@@ e-@@ inspi@@ ring mis@@ sions of planet@@ ary propor@@ tions . 
here is a background information to put this into perspective . you probably know all wikipedia , the largest wi@@ ki in the world . 
the second largest wi@@ ki in the world , with almost 8@@ 0,000 ent@@ ries is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki . 
five million people use it every month . 
you have colle@@ cted more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than about any other top@@ ic in any other wi@@ ki in the world . 
they create an epi@@ c story . 
they create an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft . 
ok , these are four super@@ power@@ s that lead to a single result . players are super@@ -@@ powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals . 
it is people who believe that as individuals they can change the world . 
and the only problem is that they think they can change the virtual world@@ s , but not the real ones . 
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve . 
ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va is a popular scientist . 
his work is aw@@ es@@ ome . he exam@@ ines why people spend so much time , energy and money in online world@@ s . 
and he says , &quot; we will wit@@ ness no less than mass migr@@ ation into virtual world@@ s and online gam@@ ing environments . &quot; 
and that of an econom@@ ist . so he is logi@@ cal . 
and he says . . . 
not like me . . . i &apos;m developing games , i &apos;m a bit ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant . 
so he says , that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in online world@@ s than in real life . 
they can make stron@@ ger social bon@@ ds in games than in real life . you get more feedback and re@@ wards in games than in real life . 
so , he says , it &apos;s perfectly logi@@ cal at the moment that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world . 
i agree , that &apos;s logi@@ cal . 
but it is definitely not an optimis@@ tic situation . 
we have to start trans@@ forming the real world into a game . 
my inspiration comes from an event that dat@@ es back 2,@@ 500 years . 
there are these anti@@ que cu@@ bes , made of she@@ ep &apos;s kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les . you know ? 
there were she@@ ep &apos;s kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les in front of these fantastic game controll@@ ers . 
and these were , so to speak , the first game machines developed by humans . 
and if you are familiar with the works of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian hero@@ do@@ tus , you may know this story . the story of how and why games were invented . 
according to hero@@ do@@ tus , games , more pre@@ cis@@ ely dic@@ e games , were invented in the king@@ dom of ly@@ dia during a fam@@ ine . 
it was said that there was such a great fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ dia decided on a crazy idea . 
the people suff@@ ered . the people were fighting . 
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution . 
so , according to hero@@ do@@ tus , they invented the dic@@ e game and agre@@ ed on a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play . 
and they would be so absor@@ bed in the dic@@ e game that games are so intri@@ gu@@ ing and surro@@ und us with satis@@ fying , bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat . 
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat . 
and according to hero@@ do@@ tus , they survi@@ ved this fam@@ ine for 18 years by eating one day and playing the next . 
lik@@ ewi@@ se , i think , we play games today . 
we use games to es@@ cape the suffering of the real world . 
we use games to es@@ cape everything that does not work in the real world , anything that is not satis@@ fying in real life , and we get what we need from the games . 
but that does not have to be the end . 
that &apos;s the exciting thing . 
according to hero@@ do@@ tus , the fam@@ ine did not improve after 18 years . so the king decided to play a last dic@@ e game . 
they divi@@ ded the king@@ dom in half . 
they played a dic@@ e game and the win@@ ners were allowed to embar@@ k on an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure . 
they left ly@@ dia and started sear@@ ching for a new home . they left just as many people as there was food to survive and sear@@ ched with the rest for a terri@@ tory where they could thri@@ ve . 
that sounds crazy , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
but recent dna evidence shows that the et@@ rus@@ cans , who later formed the ro@@ man emp@@ ire , have the same dna as the ancient ly@@ di@@ ans . 
therefore , scientists recently came to the conclu@@ sion that hero@@ do@@ tus &apos;@@ ; crazy story is actually true . 
and ge@@ ologists found evidence of a global cool@@ ing that las@@ ted nearly 20 years , which could explain the fam@@ ine . 
so this crazy story might be right . 
perhaps they have actually saved their people by playing by es@@ cap@@ ing into games for eig@@ ht@@ ee@@ n years and then having this in f@@ l u@@ ence and learning so much about playing together that they have there@@ by saved the entire civilization . 
well , we can do that too . 
we play war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 . 
this was the first real@@ -@@ time strategy game in the world of war@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago . 
they played dic@@ e games for 18 years , we have been playing war@@ craft for 16 years . 
i cla@@ im we are ready for our own epi@@ c game . 
so , they sent half of their civilization in search of a new world . so i take my 21 billion game hours a week . 
we should agree that half of us spend an hour a day playing games until we solve the problems of the real world . 
i know you will as@@ k@@ : &quot; how do we solve real world problems in gam@@ es@@ ? &quot; and it is pre@@ cis@@ ely this question that i have de@@ dic@@ ated my work to in the last few years at the institute for the future . 
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o alt@@ o , it expres@@ ses how we should understand the future . 
we do not want to try to predict the future be@@ fore@@ hand . 
what we want is to create the future . 
we want to present the best possible result . and then em@@ power people to transl@@ ate this idea into reality . 
we imagine epi@@ c vic@@ tor@@ ies and give people the opportunity to reach them . 
i will brie@@ fly show you three games that i have designed to try to give people epi@@ c vic@@ tor@@ ies in their own future . 
this is &quot; world without oil .@@ &quot; 
the game is from 2007 . 
it &apos;s an online game in which you have to over@@ come an oil shor@@ tage . 
the oil shor@@ tage is invented but we have enough online content to make it reali@@ stic for them and they actually live their real life without oil . so , when you sign up for the game , tell us where you live . and then you get real@@ -@@ time new@@ s@@ letters that show you how much oil costs , what does not exist , how food supply is affected , how transport is affected , whether schools are closed , whether there are ri@@ ots . and they have to figure out how to make their real life if it were true . and we ask you to blog about it , set videos or photos . 
we tes@@ ted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 . and we have ac@@ compan@@ ie@@ d her since then over the last three years . 
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience . 
nobody wants to change their life because it is good for the environment or because we should . 
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and you &apos;re tol@@ d@@ : &quot; we &apos;re running out of oil . &quot; 
this is a fascinating ad@@ vent@@ ure to go for . 
find out how they would survive . most of our players have kept the habit@@ s learned in the game . 
so for the next world@@ -@@ saving game we have set ourselves a bigger , higher goal than just an oil shor@@ tage . 
we have the game &quot; super@@ struc@@ t &quot; developed at the institute for the future . 
the starting point is the calcul@@ ation of a super@@ computer that people have only 23 years left on the planet . 
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global dan@@ ger sensi@@ ti@@ zation system &quot; , naturally . 
the call to players to sign up , we have almost like a &quot; %jerry-bruckheimer &quot; film designed . 
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ heim@@ er movies , where it &apos;s the &quot; dream team &quot; gives . they have the astron@@ aut , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vic@@ t and only together can they save the world . 
but in our game , rather than just 5 people , let &apos;s say everyone is in the dream team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice . 
8@@ ,000 players played the game for 8 weeks . 
they found 500 unbe@@ lie@@ va@@ bly creative solutions that they can read when they use &quot; super@@ struc@@ t &quot; to google . 
and we will rele@@ ase the last game on mar@@ ch 3@@ rd . it is a game in co@@ operation with the world bank . 
when they finish the game , they recei@@ ve the &quot; social %redesigner&quot; awar@@ d from the world bank@@ ; , gradu@@ ation 2010 . 
we work with universi@@ ties in all of black africa and invi@@ te them to learn how to transform their social lives . 
we have a com@@ ic to it . we have &quot; level up &quot; for regi@@ onal understanding , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and in@@ genu@@ ity . 
i would like to invi@@ te all of you to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in developing areas that benefit from imag@@ ining their own social activi@@ ties together to save the world . 
i &apos;m coming to the end . 
i want to ask you something . 
what , do you think happens ne@@ x@@ t@@ ? 
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have not saved the real world yet . 
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great impact on change . 
we have all these super@@ power@@ s , bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to make close social networks , ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m and the need for epi@@ c meaning . 
i really hope that together we play significant games to survive on this planet for another century . 
and i hope they will design and play with me such games . 
looking ahead to the next decade , i &apos;m sure of two thin@@ gs@@ : that we can create every imag@@ in@@ able future and that we can play all sorts of games . 
so i say , let the world@@ -@@ changing games beg@@ in@@ ! 
thank you very much . 
i would like to tell you something that i noticed a few months ago when writing an article for itali@@ an wired . 
i always had my syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary at hand when writing , but i was already done edi@@ ting the text , and i noticed that i have never looked up in my life , what the word &quot; hinder@@ s &quot; really means . 
i read you the ent@@ ry . 
&quot; with special needs &quot; , ad@@ je@@ c@@ tiv@@ e@@ : &quot; cri@@ pp@@ led , hel@@ ple@@ ss , use@@ less , destro@@ yed , dead , mu@@ ti@@ lat@@ ed , wo@@ unded , mau@@ led , lam@@ e , sever@@ ely ne@@ gl@@ ec@@ ted , dis@@ used , wea@@ ken@@ ed , im@@ poten@@ t , ca@@ strated , paraly@@ zed , hand@@ ic@@ appe@@ d sen@@ il , dec@@ re@@ pi@@ t , pulled out of traffic , re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ed , done , broken broke , coun@@ ted , see also hurt , use@@ less and wea@@ k . 
ant@@ ony@@ m@@ s@@ : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot; 
i read this list a friend al@@ oud and had to lau@@ gh first , it seemed so ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous , but i only came to &quot; prepared &quot; and could not continue talking , and had to stop reading and collect myself first after this ra@@ i@@ ding word flo@@ od and the associated emotional sho@@ ck . 
of course that was a fra@@ yed old syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary . i just thought that the issue must be quite old . 
but in fact it was an issue in the early 8@@ 0s when i first started element@@ ary school and began to build and shape my self-@@ image outside of my family environment , also with reg@@ ard to other children and the rest of the world around me . 
and thank god i did not use a syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary at that time . 
if i were to take this ent@@ ry seriously , i would have been born into a world that someone like me would percei@@ ve as a person whose life can not be posi@@ tively positive . today , however , i will be celebra@@ ting the opportunities and ad@@ vent@@ ures i have experienced . 
so i immediately called the online edi@@ tion of 2009 and expected that i find a more appe@@ aling contribu@@ tion here . 
here is the up@@ dat@@ ed version of this ent@@ ry . 
unfortunately she is not much better . 
in particular , the last two words sha@@ ke me under &quot; near ant@@ ony@@ ms &quot; &quot; all &quot; and healthy &quot; , 
but it &apos;s not just about the words . 
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words . 
it &apos;s about the values ​​that are in these words , and how we constru@@ ct those values . 
our language influ@@ ences our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us . 
many ancient societies , including the gre@@ ek@@ s and the roman@@ s , really believed that the pro@@ nu@@ n@@ ci@@ ation of a cur@@ se has a great power , because what is said al@@ oud can also mani@@ fest itself . 
so , what do we actually want to mani@@ fest - a dis@@ ab@@ led person or a powerful person@@ ? 
to call a human care@@ less@@ ly a mer@@ e child could be enough to restri@@ ct her and put her ideas to the test . 
would not it be better to open your do@@ or@@ s@@ ? 
a person who opened do@@ ors for me was my pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cian at a .@@ i . du@@ pon@@ t institute in wil@@ m@@ ington in del@@ aware . 
his name is d@@ r . pi@@ zz@@ u@@ ti@@ ll@@ o . an it@@ alo@@ -@@ american whose name , as you can imagine , most americans could not pro@@ no@@ un@@ ce cor@@ rec@@ tly . so he was always d@@ r . p . called . 
and d@@ r . p . always wor@@ e very color@@ ful flies and was just made to work with children . 
i just loved the time i spent in this hospital - except for my physi@@ o@@ therapy . 
i had to repe@@ at some exer@@ cis@@ es seem@@ ingly end@@ less@@ ly with these thi@@ ck , el@@ ast@@ ic band@@ s - in different colors - that you know to build my leg mus@@ cles . and i hat@@ ed those band@@ s more than anything else . i hat@@ ed her . i cur@@ sed her . i hat@@ ed her . 
and imagine , even as a five-@@ year-old child with d@@ r . p . negoti@@ ated and tried to stop these exer@@ cis@@ es , of course , without success . 
and one day he obser@@ ved me on one of my exer@@ cis@@ es - those exer@@ cis@@ es were just ti@@ res@@ ome and mer@@ ci@@ less - and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you are such a strong , powerful and young girl , you will one day become one ri@@ p these ri@@ b@@ bon@@ s . 
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
of course that was just a trick from d@@ r . p . so i do the exer@@ cis@@ es i did not want to do , with the pro@@ spec@@ t of becoming the rich@@ est five-@@ year-old girl in the infi@@ r@@ mary on the second floor . but he actually got me to see my daily exercise hor@@ ror with new eyes . this became a new and promis@@ ing experience . 
and today i wonder how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl has sha@@ ped my self-@@ image and how i could imagine myself as a naturally strong , powerful and at@@ let@@ hi@@ c man . 
this is just one of many examples of how adults in power posi@@ tions can stimul@@ ate a child &apos;s imagination . 
but as the examples quot@@ ed in the syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ aries prove , our language leaves us no room to imagine anything we would all wish for@@ : en@@ ab@@ ling each one to see himself as a powerful human being . 
our language la@@ gs behind the social changes that have in many cases been tri@@ g@@ gere@@ d by technological change . 
from the medical point of view , of course , my legs , the las@@ er surgery for vision imp@@ air@@ ments , k@@ nee jo@@ in@@ ts made of ti@@ tan@@ ium and artificial hi@@ p jo@@ in@@ ts for aging bodies that allow people to really use all their possibilities and reach beyond the limit@@ s that they have their natural des@@ tiny has been to develop , not to speak of social net@@ working plat@@ forms , to en@@ able people to create their own identity , to define themselves in their own way , and th@@ us to ori@@ ent themselves around the world to groups they choose for themselves . 
maybe this technological change will make it clear@@ er than ever that there has always been another truth , nam@@ ely , that every human being can give something very special and powerful to society and that human adap@@ ta@@ bility is our greatest plus . 
the human capacity to adap@@ t - that &apos;s an interesting story , because people keep asking me to tell them how to deal with ad@@ versi@@ ty and i &apos;ll conf@@ ess something to them@@ : that sentence never su@@ ited me and i &apos;ve always felt very un@@ comfortable with it to answer the questions of people to do so , and i think , gradu@@ ally , i understand why . 
this notion of dealing with ad@@ versi@@ ty lives from the idea that success or happiness depen@@ ds on mas@@ ter@@ ing a challenge without being influ@@ enced by the associated experience . as if my life had been so successful because i could avoid the possible fall of a life with a pro@@ s@@ thesis , or whatever people percei@@ ve me to be with my dis@@ ability . 
but the truth is that we are changing . of course , we are sha@@ ped by the challenge , whether it is physical , emotional or even both 
and i say that &apos;s good . 
ad@@ versi@@ ty is not an obs@@ tac@@ le that we have to go around to better cop@@ e with our lives . 
ad@@ versi@@ ty is simply part of our life . 
and i tend to see ad@@ versi@@ ty as my sha@@ dow . 
sometimes i realize that he is very present , sometimes he is bar@@ ely visible , but he is always with me . 
and i do not want to reduce the impact or the sever@@ ity of a person &apos;s fight . 
there are ad@@ versi@@ ties and challenges in life , and they are all too real and each person is treated differently . but the question is not whether we get along with ad@@ versi@@ ty or not , but how we hand@@ le it . 
so , not only are we responsible for prote@@ cting the people we love from fa@@ tali@@ ties , but also prepar@@ ing them to deal with them well . 
and we do not please our children if we make them feel they can not adap@@ t . 
there are two things that must be clearly separ@@ ate@@ d@@ : fir@@ stly , the medical fact of being am@@ pu@@ tat@@ ed and , secon@@ dly , the social opini@@ on about whether i am dis@@ ab@@ led or not . 
and to be honest , the only real and las@@ ting dis@@ ability i have had to deal with is that the world constantly thinks that it can describe me with these defini@@ tions . 
in our desire to protect the people we care about and share with them the cold , har@@ sh truth about their medical pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis , or even to fore@@ cast the quality of life that aw@@ ai@@ ts them , we need to be care@@ ful that we do not lay the gro@@ und@@ work for it that someone is actually dis@@ ab@@ led . 
perhaps the current concept , which only looks at what is broken in one , and how we fix it , is more dis@@ ab@@ ling for everyone than the path@@ ology itself . 
if we do not treat a person hol@@ is@@ tically , and do not percei@@ ve and ac@@ knowledge all of his or her power@@ s and potential , we create another illness in addition to the natural struggle that they may have to wa@@ ge . 
we de@@ grade a person who has value for our society . 
so we need to look beyond pat@@ ology and focus on all areas of human potential . 
most importantly , there is a connection between the perception of our shor@@ t@@ com@@ ings and our great in@@ genu@@ ity . 
we should not de@@ value or den@@ y these challen@@ ging times , we should nei@@ ther try to avoid them , nor should we swe@@ ep them under the car@@ pet , but it is about identi@@ fying opportunities in the ad@@ versi@@ ties . 
i may be more concerned with cla@@ ri@@ fying that we do not necessarily have to over@@ come ad@@ versi@@ ty , but that we are open to embra@@ ce them , to put them on their to@@ es and even to use a fight expression and maybe even to dance with it , 
and maybe we manage to see ad@@ versi@@ ties as something natural , co@@ her@@ ent and useful , and th@@ us feel less bur@@ den@@ ed by their pres@@ ence . 
this year we celebra@@ te the 200@@ th birth@@ day of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin poin@@ ted out , in my eyes , something very true in the human character . 
i would put it this wa@@ y@@ : not the stron@@ gest of its kind survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intelligent of its kind , but the one who can best adap@@ t to changes . 
confli@@ cts create creativity . 
not only from darwin &apos;s work do we know that man &apos;s ability to survive and flo@@ ur@@ ish is determin@@ ed by the struggle of the human mind to change through conflict . 
so , again , change and adap@@ tation are the greatest abilities of man . 
and maybe we only know from what wood we are car@@ ved , when we are really tes@@ ted . 
perhaps this is pre@@ cis@@ ely the sense of ad@@ versi@@ ty , a sense of self , a sense of our own power . 
we can give ourselves something like that . 
we can give a new meaning to ad@@ versi@@ ty that goes beyond hard times . 
maybe we can see ad@@ versi@@ ty as a change . 
ad@@ versi@@ ty represents a change we have not yet adap@@ ted to . 
i think the biggest har@@ m we &apos;ve done to ourselves is belie@@ ving that we should be normal . 
let &apos;s face it - who is normal@@ ? 
there is no normal . 
there is the usual . the typical . but not the normal one . and would you really want to meet this poor , gra@@ y person , if they really exist@@ ed@@ ? 
i do not think so . 
it would be great to be able to exchange this pattern of normal@@ ity for another of the possibilities , or the strength to even make it a little more dangerous . so we can un@@ lea@@ sh the power of a great many children and invi@@ te them to bring their very special and valuable skills to society . 
anthropo@@ logi@@ sts have found out that we have always dem@@ and@@ ed of people from members of our society one thin@@ g@@ : to be useful and to make a contribu@@ tion . 
there is evidence that ne@@ anderth@@ als were already carrying older people and people with sever@@ e physical in@@ ju@@ ries 6@@ 0,000 years ago , and maybe that was because the life experience in these people &apos;s survival struggle was valuable to socie@@ ty@@ : 
they did not consider these people as broken and use@@ less@@ ; they were treated as something special and valuable . 
a few years ago , in the town where i grew up , i went to a food market in that &quot; red zone &quot; in nor@@ the@@ astern pen@@ n@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , and i stood there in front of a bus@@ he@@ l of tom@@ at@@ o@@ es . 
it was summer and i had shor@@ ts on . 
and i hear , as a guy says behind me , &quot; well , if that is not ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot; 
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is . 
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know each other@@ ? i can not remember them . &quot; 
and he said , &quot; well , they should hard@@ ly remember me . 
when i saw her for the first time , i got her out of her mother &apos;s bel@@ ly . &quot; 
oh , so that . 
and of course it was cli@@ cked . 
that was d@@ r . ke@@ an , a man i knew only from my mother &apos;s tal@@ es about this day , because of course , quite typically , i came two weeks late for my birth@@ day . 
my mother &apos;s pre@@ nat@@ al diagno@@ sis doctor was on vac@@ ation , so my parents did not know the man who brought me to the world . 
and because i was born without my cal@@ f , and my feet were direc@@ ted at them , and i had only a few to@@ es on this and a few to@@ es on the other foot , he was the be@@ are@@ r , this stran@@ ger had to deliver the bad news . 
he said to me@@ : &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never run , and never be as mobile as other children , or that you could never lead an independent life , and since then they have simply pun@@ ished me . &quot; 
i found it really extraordinary that he colle@@ cted newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings of my entire childhood , no matter if i had won in a secon@@ d-@@ grade sp@@ elling competition , whether i was on hall@@ o@@ ween with the sc@@ out@@ s at the para@@ de , no matter if i got my scho@@ lar@@ ship or one of my vic@@ tor@@ i@@ ous vic@@ tor@@ ies , and he used these exc@@ er@@ p@@ ts to teach his students , medical students from ha@@ hn@@ em@@ ann medical school and her@@ she@@ y medical school . 
and he called this part of his course the x factor , the potential of the human will . 
you simply can not emp@@ has@@ ize enough how cru@@ cial this factor can be for a person &apos;s quality of life . 
and d@@ r . ke@@ an continu@@ ed , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if they &apos;re not constantly told otherwise , and even if they get only a little support , if children are left to themselves , then children can achieve a lot .@@ &quot; ; 
you see , d@@ r . ke@@ an has changed his thinking . 
he had understood that the medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone dea@@ ls with it , are two different things . 
and also i have changed my thinking over time , if you had asked me at the age of fif@@ te@@ en , if i had ex@@ changed my pro@@ s@@ thetic legs for legs and legs , then i would not have he@@ si@@ tat@@ ed for a second . 
i really wanted to look normal then . 
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure . 
and that happened because i experienced something with my legs and not despite these experiences . 
and maybe this change could happen because i met so many people who opened my do@@ ors instead of meeting people who wanted to lim@@ it me or put me in the picture . 
you see , it really only takes one person to demon@@ strate to them how they can mani@@ fest their power@@ s and they are through . 
if you en@@ able someone to activ@@ ate your own inner power@@ s - the human mind is so rec@@ ep@@ tive - if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ cial moment , then you are a very good teacher for these people . 
they teach them to open their do@@ ors . 
the actual meaning of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; roo@@ ted in the word &quot; educ@@ e &quot; , 
it means producing something that is in one , the potential to tea@@ se out . 
aga@@ in@@ : what potential do we want to re@@ trie@@ ve no@@ w@@ ? 
a case study was conduc@@ ted in the u@@ k in the 196@@ 0s . at that time , high schools were conver@@ ted into secon@@ dar@@ y schools . 
they call that &quot; stre@@ aming trials &quot; in the us , we call this &quot; tracking &quot; , 
the students are divi@@ ded according to gra@@ des . 
and the students are more hea@@ vil@@ y or@@ ally tes@@ ted , get the better teachers , etc . 
you then have a three-@@ month period of study with a &quot; suff@@ i@@ cient &quot; the note &quot; very good &quot; given . they were told they were bad , that they were very smart . and after these three months , they really wrote one . 
and , of course , it break@@ s one &apos;s heart to hear that , conver@@ sely , the one-@@ students were told they were only ade@@ qua@@ te . 
and that &apos;s how it was after the three months , too . 
but only those who were still in school apart from the students who had dro@@ pped out of school . 
the decisi@@ ve factor in this study was that the teachers were not initi@@ ated . 
the teachers did not know that something had changed . 
they were simply told that they were the one-@@ and-@@ one students and that the students with the note are suff@@ i@@ cient . and that &apos;s how they taught them and treated them . 
the only real dis@@ ability is a broken mind a spirit that has been broken has no hope anymore . he does not find anything nice anymore . he la@@ cks our natural , child@@ like curi@@ osity . and our inn@@ ate ability of imagination . 
but if we manage to support the human spirit , to continue to hope , to find ourselves and other people around , to be curious and imag@@ in@@ ative , then we will really use our power@@ s in a positive way . 
when a mind has these quali@@ ties , we can create a new reality and new forms of being . 
i would like to conclu@@ de with a poe@@ m written by a pers@@ ian poe@@ t called ha@@ fi@@ z in the 14@@ th century , about which my friend jac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is told me . and the poe@@ m means &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows god , not the god of names , not the god of pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , but the god who only knows four words and constantly repe@@ ats them , he always says on@@ ly@@ : come , dance with me . &quot; 
come dance with me . many thanks . 
how would you like to be better than you are right no@@ w@@ ? 
suppose , i said that with a few changes in your genes , you could have a better memory - more accu@@ rate , more accu@@ rate and faster . 
or do you want to be fit@@ ter , stron@@ ger , have more power . 
do you want to become more attra@@ ctive and self-@@ confi@@ dent@@ ? 
how about living longer with good health@@ ? 
or maybe you are one of those who have always lon@@ ged for more creativity . 
which one would you like the mo@@ st@@ ? 
which one would you like to have if she could have one@@ ? 
creativity . 
how many people would choose crea@@ tivi@@ ty@@ ? 
raise your hands . let me see . 
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here . 
that is very good . 
how many would choose for a good memor@@ y@@ ? 
a few more . 
how about fit@@ nes@@ s@@ ? 
a few less . 
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty@@ ? 
ah , the majority . i like that , as a doctor . 
if only they could have one , it would be a different world . 
is this all just imag@@ i@@ nation@@ ? 
or is it possi@@ ble@@ ? 
evolution has been an on@@ going theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor on the subject . 
the great gene@@ tic@@ ist in the 20th century , t .@@ g . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a communic@@ ator in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote an ess@@ ay enti@@ t@@ led &quot; nothing in biology makes any sense except in the light of evolution . &quot; 
well , if you are one of those who do not accept pro@@ of of biological evolution , this would be a good time to turn off your hearing aid , take your personal communication device - i give you the per@@ mission - and maybe you can take another look kat@@ hr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos;@@ ; to throw a book , which is about being wrong , because nothing in the further course of this speech will make any sense for them . 
but if you accept biological evolution , consider the follo@@ win@@ g@@ : is it just the past , or is it also about the fu@@ tur@@ e@@ ? 
is it val@@ id or is it affec@@ ting us@@ ? 
this is another look at the tree of life . 
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of bran@@ ches in all direc@@ tions , because when looking at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , all exist@@ ing species at the ti@@ ps of these bran@@ ches have succe@@ ed@@ ed in evolutionary ter@@ m@@ s@@ : they have survi@@ ve@@ d@@ ; it has demon@@ strated fit@@ ness and strength to its surro@@ und@@ ings . 
the human part of this bush , far to the end , of course , is what we are most interested in . 
we bran@@ ch from a common ance@@ sto@@ r to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago . 
in this period , there were maybe 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds . 
some came and went . 
we have been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years . 
it seems we are quite isol@@ ated from the other parts of the tree of life , but for the most part , the basic mechanis@@ ms of our cells are pretty much the same . 
do you realize that we can benefit from this and requi@@ si@@ tion the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteri@@ um to produce the protein of the human insu@@ lin that is used to treat diab@@ et@@ ic@@ s@@ ? 
this is not like human insu@@ lin@@ ; this is the same protein that is chemi@@ cally %indistinguishable from what comes out of the pan@@ crea@@ s . 
and while we &apos;re talking about bacteria , are you aware that each one of us in our bow@@ el car@@ ries more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our bo@@ dy@@ ? 
maybe 10 times as many . 
i mean , do you think , when ant@@ ony dama@@ si@@ o asks for her self-@@ image , do you think about the bacteri@@ a@@ ? 
our inte@@ stin@@ e is a wonder@@ fully hospit@@ able environment for these bacteria . 
it is warm , it is dark , it is hum@@ id , it is very co@@ zy . 
and you will provide them with all the nutri@@ ents they could wish for without effort on their part . 
it is really an easy way for bacteria , with occasi@@ onal inter@@ rup@@ tions of the un@@ inten@@ tional , ever forced bu@@ mp to the exi@@ t . 
but otherwise , they are a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important to their lives . 
they help in the dig@@ esti@@ on of essential nutri@@ ents . and they protect you against certain diseases . 
but what will come in the fu@@ tur@@ e@@ ? 
are we in an evolutionary equi@@ libr@@ ium in the form of a speci@@ es@@ ? 
or are we dest@@ ined to become something else - something that may even be better adap@@ ted to the environ@@ ment@@ ? 
now let us take a step back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago - the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago - the first sign@@ s of life , maybe three to four billion years on earth - the first several cell@@ ular organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago - and then the human species , which eventually forms over the last 13@@ 0,000 years . 
in this vast un@@ finished symp@@ hon@@ y of the universe , life on earth is shor@@ t-@@ li@@ ve@@ d@@ ; the animal king@@ dom , like a single stro@@ ke@@ ; and human life , a little note or@@ nam@@ ent . 
that was us . 
this is also the enter@@ tainment value of this speech , so i hope you enjo@@ yed it . 
well , when i was a fres@@ hm@@ an in college , i had my first biology class@@ es . 
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology . 
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundament@@ al@@ : in most of the existence of life in uni@@ cell@@ ular organisms , each cell spli@@ ts , and all the genetic information of the cell is passed on in both daughter cells . 
but by the time multi@@ cell@@ ular organisms appe@@ ared , things began to change . 
sexual re@@ production comes into the picture . 
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of the sexual re@@ production that pas@@ ses the genome , the rest of the body becomes expen@@ dab@@ le . 
in fact , one could say that the inevi@@ table death of our body in evolution occur@@ s at the same time as sexual re@@ production . 
now i have to ad@@ mit , when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex - it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with every pas@@ sing year , my growing dou@@ b@@ ts have come , 
i came to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , who perfor@@ med his show in las ve@@ gas in the 90 &apos;s . 
and one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck on his hotel room door . 
he open@@ s the door . 
in front of him is a beauti@@ fully scan@@ ti@@ ly dr@@ essed sho@@ w@@ girl . 
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot; 
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the sou@@ p . &quot; 
i came to the reali@@ zation as a doctor that i worked towards a goal that was different from the goal of evolution - not necessarily contra@@ dic@@ tory , just different . 
i tried to save the body . 
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy . 
i wanted to rest@@ ore my health after illness . 
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life . 
evolution is all about pas@@ sing the genome on to the next generation , adap@@ ting and survi@@ ving generation after generation . 
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are developed like boo@@ ster rock@@ ets to send the genetic car@@ go to the next level of the orbit and then drop into the sea . 
i think we would all understand the mo@@ od that woo@@ dy expres@@ sed to everyone when he said , &quot; i do not want to be imm@@ or@@ tal through my work . 
i want to achieve it by not dying . &quot; 
evolution does not necessarily mean to pre@@ fer the lon@@ gest life . 
it does not necessarily privi@@ lege the biggest , the stron@@ gest or the fas@@ test , and not even the smar@@ test . 
evolution privi@@ leg@@ es the creatures that best adap@@ t to their environment . 
it is only the test of survival and success 
on the ocean floor there are bacteria that are ther@@ mo@@ phili@@ c and th@@ us survive the hot ste@@ am otherwise , if fish were there , it would result in vac@@ u@@ um coo@@ ked fish , yet they managed to make there a habit@@ able environment for themselves . 
so , what does that mean when we look back on what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place of humans in evolution , and most importantly how we look ahead to the next phase , i would say it &apos;s a series of possibilities there . 
the first is that we will not evol@@ ve . 
we have reach@@ ed a kind of balance . 
and the reasons for that would be that , first of all , through medicine , we managed to get a lot of genes that would otherwise have been elimin@@ ated and re@@ moved from the population . 
and secon@@ dly , we as a special have con@@ figured our environment so that we have managed to adap@@ t to it exactly as we adap@@ t to it 
and by the way , we walk and circu@@ late and min@@ gle so much that they can no longer say that isol@@ ation is necessary for evolution to take place . 
a second possibility is that it will be an evolution of the traditional kind , of course , im@@ posed by the forces of nature . 
and the argument here is that the whe@@ els of evolution are slowly gri@@ n@@ ding but they are rel@@ ent@@ less . 
and as far as isol@@ ation goes , as we col@@ oni@@ ze dist@@ ant planets as species , there will be isol@@ ation and the changes in the environment that evolution could naturally produce . 
but there is a third possibility , a tan@@ tali@@ zing , fascinating and fri@@ ght@@ ening possibility 
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution - the new development that is not simply natural , but gui@@ ded and decided by us as individuals . in the decisions we make . 
well , how could that happen@@ ? 
how could it be possible for us to do thi@@ s@@ ? 
first of all , let &apos;s look at the reality that people are making decisions about their des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts in some cultures today . 
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women . 
it is not necessarily good for the society , but it is what deci@@ des the individual and the family . 
so think , if it were not only possible to choose the sex of your child but also to make genetic ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments to the body that would cure and prevent ill@@ nes@@ ses . 
what if you could make the genetic changes to er@@ adi@@ cate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or reduce your cancer risk or elimin@@ ate stro@@ ke@@ ? 
would not you want to make these changes in your gene@@ s@@ ? 
as we look ahead , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible . 
the human genome project began in 199@@ 0 and took 13 years to complete . 
it cost $ 2.@@ 7 billion . 
the following year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same for $ 20 million in three to four months . 
today you can complete a sequence of the three billion base pa@@ irs of the human genome at a cost of about $ 20@@ ,000 and in the space of about a week . 
it will not be long before the reality is that there will be the $ 1,000 human genome , and it will be increasingly available to everyone . 
a week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering awar@@ ded the dra@@ per prize to fran@@ ci@@ s ar@@ no@@ ld and will@@ em ste@@ mmer , two scientists who indepen@@ dent@@ ly developed techniques that encourage evolution &apos;s natural process to work faster and lead to des@@ ira@@ ble proteins in a more efficient man@@ ner - which fran@@ ces ar@@ no@@ ld &quot; direct evolution &quot; is called . 
a few years ago , the las@@ ker prize was awar@@ ded to scientist shi@@ n@@ ya y@@ ama@@ na@@ ka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ blas@@ t , and by manipu@@ lat@@ ing only four genes that indu@@ ced cell to lead them to a plu@@ ri@@ poten@@ t stem cell - one cell poten@@ tially capable of becoming any cell in your body . 
these changes are coming . 
the same technology that produ@@ ces human insu@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that can not only protect themselves , but can also serve to imm@@ unity to other viruses . 
believe it or not , it is an experiment@@ al study in progress with vac@@ cin@@ e against influ@@ enz@@ a grown in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant . 
can you imagine something good coming from to@@ bac@@ co@@ ? 
this is all reality today and much more will be possible in the future . 
then imagine only two other min@@ or changes . 
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts@@ ? 
what if you could change the sper@@ m and eg@@ g cells or the fres@@ hl@@ y ferti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g to give your children a better chance of a health@@ ier life - elimin@@ ating diabetes , elimin@@ ating he@@ mo@@ phili@@ a , redu@@ cing the risk of can@@ cer@@ ? 
who does not want health@@ ier childr@@ en@@ ? 
and then the analy@@ tic techni@@ que , the same motor of science that can en@@ able the changes to prevent disease , could also en@@ able us to adop@@ t adop@@ t %super-attributes , %hyper-capacities - the better memory . 
why have not you had the wi@@ t of a ken jen@@ ning , especially if you can expan@@ d it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machin@@ e@@ ? 
why not have the fast muscle fi@@ bers that will en@@ able them to run faster and lon@@ ger@@ ? 
why not live lon@@ ger@@ ? 
these will be ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble . 
and when we are in a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes we want , we will be trans@@ formed from ol@@ d-@@ style evolution to ne@@ o-@@ evolution . 
we will have a process that may typically take 100,000 years , and we can comp@@ ress it to a thousand years - and maybe even the next 100 years . 
these are the decisions that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , must deal with . 
do we use these decisions to shape a society that is better , more successful , friend@@ lie@@ r@@ ? 
or will we sele@@ c@@ tively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for other@@ s@@ ? 
will we form a society that is more bor@@ ing and uni@@ formed , or more rob@@ ust and ver@@ sat@@ il@@ e@@ ? 
these are the kinds of questions we have to face . 
and at the deep@@ est of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and master the wisdom that we will need to make these decisions wis@@ el@@ y@@ ? 
good and bad , and so@@ one@@ r than you might think these decisions will be up to us . 
thank you . 
i want you to imagine something , a port@@ able robot that gives you super@@ human abilities , or another that helps whe@@ el@@ chair users get back up and walking . 
we at ber@@ kel@@ ey bio@@ ni@@ cs call these robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons . 
they are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning and that add@@ s strength to you and that will further increase your speed and help you , for example , keep your balance . 
that is indeed the true fusion of man and machine . 
but not only that - they mer@@ ge and network with the universe and other devices out there . 
this is not just a crazy idea . 
to show you now what we are working on , we start by talking about the american soldi@@ er , who car@@ ries on average about 100 pounds on his back , and there is a requ@@ est that they should carry more equipment . 
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations - back in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of them - chron@@ ic back in@@ ju@@ ries . 
so we figured we would take on this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help deal with this problem . 
let me introduce you to hu@@ l@@ c - or the human universal load car@@ rier . 
soldi@@ er@@ : with the hu@@ l@@ c ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on i can carry 200 pounds over various terr@@ ain , many hours long . 
its flexi@@ ble design allows you to squ@@ at down , cra@@ w@@ l and perfor@@ m highly agi@@ le movements . 
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increas@@ es my strength and end@@ ur@@ ance . 
we are ready to introduce this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on this year with our industrial partner of this device . 
it is true . 
now let &apos;s take a look at the whe@@ el@@ chair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about . 
there are 6@@ 8 million people in the whe@@ el@@ chair who are valu@@ ed worldwide . 
that &apos;s about one percent of the total population . 
and that is indeed a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate . 
we often talk about very young people with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ries who were struc@@ k by fa@@ te in the flo@@ wer@@ ing years of their lives - 20@@ s , 30@@ s , 40@@ s - and the whe@@ el@@ chair is the only option . 
but it is also about the aging population , whose number multi@@ pli@@ es . 
and pretty much the only option - when it comes to a stro@@ ke or other compli@@ cations - is the whe@@ el@@ chair . 
and that &apos;s the way it has been for 500 years , since , as i have to say , its a very successful laun@@ ch . 
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chap@@ ter on mobili@@ ty . 
let me now introduce you to ele@@ gs , wor@@ n by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel , who suff@@ ered a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ry 19 years ago , as a result of which she has not been able to walk for 19 years and until now . 
many thanks . 
as i said , am@@ anda wea@@ rs our ele@@ gs . 
it has sensor@@ s - 
its completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ s in the cru@@ t@@ ches , the signals sent back to our on@@ board computer , which is attac@@ hed here on her back . 
there are also battery pac@@ ks here , the motor drive is on your hi@@ ps , as well as on your k@@ nee jo@@ in@@ ts , which move you forward in this fairly supp@@ le and very natural way . 
i was 24 years old and in the best of shape , as a mon@@ stro@@ us pur@@ l tree while a sk@@ i run paraly@@ zed me . 
in the fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every emotion and every movement below my pool . 
not long after , a doctor walked into my si@@ ck@@ room and said , &quot; am@@ anda , you will never be able to walk again . &quot; 
and that was 19 years ago . 
he stol@@ e every spar@@ k of hope from my consciousness . 
adap@@ tive technologies have since en@@ ab@@ led me to learn to sk@@ i again , to clim@@ b and even to ride my hands . 
but nothing was invented that would let me go , until now . 
many thanks . 
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet and discus@@ s . 
it is in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations - not just for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all whe@@ el@@ chair users , but for all . 
many thanks . 
at home in new york , i am head of the development department of a non-@@ profit organization called rob@@ in hood . 
if i do not fight poverty , i fight as a mate of a fire bri@@ ga@@ de cap@@ tain at a volun@@ tar@@ y del@@ e@@ tion fire . 
well , in our city , where volunte@@ ers support a highly s@@ killed fire department , you have to be at the fire department fairly early to get involved . 
i remember my first fire . 
i was the second volunte@@ er at the fire site , so i had quite good chan@@ ces to get in . 
but it was still a race against the other volunte@@ ers to reach the responsible cap@@ tain and find out what our tas@@ ks would be . 
when i found the cap@@ tain , he had just enter@@ ed into a very serious conversation with the home@@ ow@@ ner , who certainly had one of the worst days of her life . 
it was in the middle of the night and she was standing in her pa@@ jam@@ as and bar@@ e@@ foot under a screen outside in the po@@ uring rain while her house was on fire . 
the other volunte@@ er who arrived just before me - let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther - arrived at the first man and was asked to go into the house and res@@ cu@@ e the ow@@ ner &apos;s dog . 
the dog ! i was spee@@ ch@@ less with en@@ vy . 
there was some law@@ yer or asse@@ t mana@@ ger who could tell people for the rest of his life that he was going to a burning house to save a crea@@ ture just because he was five seconds faster than me . 
well , i was the next one . 
the cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me to him . 
he said , &quot; be@@ zo@@ s , you have to go into the house . 
you have to go up@@ sta@@ irs , past the fire , and get some shoes for this woman . &quot; 
i swe@@ ar . 
well , not exactly what i was hop@@ ing for , but i started walking - up the sta@@ irs , down the hall , to the &quot; real@@ &quot; one@@ s@@ ; fire@@ figh@@ ters who were already pretty much done with the clear@@ ing at that time , in the bedro@@ om to get some shoes . 
i know what you think now , but i &apos;m not a hero . 
i car@@ ried my pre@@ y back down to where i met my ene@@ my and met the belo@@ ved dog at the front door . 
we car@@ ried our tre@@ as@@ ures out to the home@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpris@@ ingly , his much more attention than mine . 
a few weeks later , the fire station received a letter from the home@@ ow@@ ner than@@ king her for her val@@ i@@ ant ef@@ fort@@ s to res@@ cu@@ e her home . 
an above all appreci@@ ated friend@@ lin@@ ess@@ : someone had even brought her some shoes . 
both in my job at rob@@ in hood and in my part time as a volunte@@ er fire@@ figh@@ ter , i am a wit@@ ness of gener@@ osity and friend@@ lin@@ ess on a large scale , but i also see acts of char@@ ity and coura@@ ge of individuals . 
and do you know what i have lear@@ ne@@ d@@ ? 
they are all important . 
so , if i look around the room and see people who have either achie@@ ved a not@@ e@@ wor@@ thy success or are on their way there , i would like to offer the following remin@@ der@@ : do not wait . 
do not wait to make a difference in someone else &apos;s life until you reach your first million . 
if they have something to give , give it now . 
serve in a sou@@ p kitchen , clean up a park in the neighbor@@ ho@@ od@@ , 
be a ment@@ or . 
not every day will give us a chance to save the life of a human , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one . 
so they set off@@ ; save the shoes . 
many thanks . 
bru@@ no gui@@ ss@@ ani@@ : mark , mark , come back . 
many thanks . 
i have just come back from a community that knows the secret of the continu@@ ation of humanity . 
a place where women lead the sc@@ ep@@ ter with sex &apos;@@ ; hell@@ o &apos;@@ ; say , and game determin@@ es the day - where fun is a serious matter . 
and no , it &apos;s not burning man or san francisco . 
my ladies and gentle@@ men , their rela@@ tives . 
this is the world of wild bon@@ ob@@ os in the jung@@ le of kon@@ go . 
bon@@ ob@@ os , together with chimpanze@@ es , are our clo@@ se@@ st living rela@@ tives . 
that means we have a common ance@@ sto@@ r , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago . 
well , chimpanze@@ es are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ ven@@ ess . 
but , unfortunately , we have over@@ -@@ emp@@ has@@ i@@ zed this aspe@@ ct in the narra@@ tive of human evolution . 
but bon@@ ob@@ os show us the other side of the me@@ da@@ l 
while chimpanze@@ es are led by big , sc@@ ary people , the bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ powered fe@@ mal@@ es . 
they have really come up with something , because that leads to a very toler@@ ant society in which dea@@ dly violence has not been obser@@ ved so far . 
but unfortunately bon@@ ob@@ os are least known among the pri@@ mates . 
they live in the dep@@ ths of the con@@ gol@@ ese jung@@ le , and are difficult to access . 
the con@@ go is a parado@@ x - a land of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dar@@ kn@@ ess itself - the scene of a violent conflict that has been ra@@ ging for decades and has cla@@ im@@ ed almost as many lives as the first world war . 
it is not surprising that this destruction also en@@ danger@@ s the bon@@ ob@@ os &apos; survival . 
meat tra@@ ding and the dec@@ line of tree population means that you can not even fill a stad@@ ium with the rema@@ ining bon@@ ob@@ os - and even then we are not sure , to be honest . 
and yet , in this land of violence and chaos , one can hear a hidden lau@@ gh that sha@@ kes the trees . 
who are these rela@@ tiv@@ es@@ ? 
we know it as &quot; love instead of war &quot; mon@@ keys , because they have frequ@@ ent , even bi@@ sexual sex , with changing partner@@ s , and so sett@@ le confli@@ cts and social issues . 
i am not saying that is the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems - because the life of the bon@@ ob@@ os consi@@ sts of more than the kam@@ a su@@ tra . 
bon@@ ob@@ os - like humans - love to play their lives for a long time . 
game does not just mean playing with children . 
for us and her , playing is fundamental to building relationships and main@@ tain@@ ing toler@@ ance . 
we learn confidence and the rules of the game . 
play increas@@ es creativity and resili@@ ence , and it is above all about the creation of diversity - variety of inter@@ actions , diversity of behavior , variety of connections . 
and when you watch bon@@ ob@@ os playing , you see the evolutionary origin@@ s of human laugh@@ ter , dance , and ritu@@ als . 
play is the pu@@ tty that kee@@ ps us together . 
well , i do not know how they play , but i want to show you some unique sho@@ ts straight out of the wild@@ s . 
first a ball game on bon@@ ob@@ o-@@ style - and i do not think about foot@@ ball . 
so here we see a young female and male in a cha@@ se game . 
look at what she does . 
that could be the evolutionary orig@@ in o@@ f@@ : &quot; she grab@@ s him by the eg@@ gs . &quot; 
only that i think he lik@@ es it more , does not it@@ ? 
yes ! 
sex games are so common , both bon@@ ob@@ os and humans . 
and this video is really interesting , because it shows - and this video is really interesting , because it shows the wealth of ideas , with the new elements in the game brings - like the tes@@ tic@@ les - and also , as the game requires both trust and also pro@@ mot@@ es - while at the same time makes tremendous fun . 
but the game is a sha@@ pe@@ shif@@ ter . 
play is a sha@@ pe@@ shif@@ ter and it can take on many forms , some of which are a little quie@@ ter , imag@@ in@@ ative , curious - perhaps to re@@ discover ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ment . 
and i want to show you this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she plays pe@@ ac@@ efully with water . 
i think , like us , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundar@@ ies of our inner and out@@ er world@@ s . 
and it is this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that lets us explore and interact . and the un@@ expected links that we form are the real bre@@ eding ground of creativity . 
this is only a small taste of the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ os give us in our past and present . 
but they also keep a secret for our future , a future in which we need to adap@@ t to increasing challenges , greater creativity and greater co@@ operation . 
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills . 
in other words , play is our adap@@ tation jo@@ ker . 
in order to success@@ fully adap@@ t to an uns@@ table world , we have to play . 
but will we make the most of our play@@ -@@ instin@@ ct@@ ? 
game is not sil@@ ly@@ , 
but essential . 
for bon@@ ob@@ os and humans ali@@ ke , life does not consi@@ st of teeth and ste@@ aling alone . 
when it seems hard@@ ly appropriate , game is perhaps the most necessary . 
and therefore , my pri@@ mate mates , let us embra@@ ce and play together this gift of evolution as we re@@ discover creativity , cam@@ ar@@ ade@@ ri@@ e , and ama@@ ze@@ ment . 
thank you . 
i would like you to introduce yourself two cou@@ ples , in the middle of 197@@ 9 , on the very same day , at the exac@@ t same moment , each be@@ ars a baby - okay . 
so two cou@@ ples , each te@@ stif@@ ies a baby . 
now i do not want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the generation , because if you imagine the generation all the time , you will not listen to me . 
imagine that only for a moment . 
and in this scen@@ ario , imagine that in one case the sper@@ m car@@ ries a y-@@ chromo@@ some that hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g . 
and in the other case , the sper@@ m car@@ ries an x chromo@@ some that hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g . 
both are capable of survival , both ig@@ ni@@ te . 
we will come back to these people later . 
i have two hat@@ s on most of my activi@@ ties . 
under a hat , i deal with the history of the an@@ atom@@ y . 
i am a graduate in history , and in this case i study how people deal with an@@ atom@@ y - i . human bodies , animal bodies - how they dea@@ lt with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ ids , with body concep@@ ts@@ ; as they thought about bodies . 
the other hat i have wor@@ n in my work is the activi@@ st , as a patient ad@@ vo@@ cate - or , as i sometimes say , an im@@ patient soli@@ ci@@ tor - of people who are patients of doctors . 
in this case , i have worked with people who have body types that question social norm@@ s . 
for example , i worked with people who are si@@ am@@ ese twi@@ ns , two people in one body . 
i worked with people with d@@ war@@ fis@@ m - people who were smaller than usual . 
and very often i have worked with inter@@ sex people whose sex is a@@ typical - that is , people who do not have the average male or female body type . 
and as a general term we can use the word inter@@ sexu@@ ality . 
inter@@ sexu@@ ality occur@@ s in many different forms . 
i &apos;ll give you just a few examples of the possible types of gender vari@@ ants that do not con@@ form to the male or female standard . 
in one case you may have someone with an x@@ y chromo@@ some base , and the sy@@ st gen of the y cho@@ mo@@ some makes the proto@@ gon@@ ads , which we all have fe@@ tal stage , grow into tes@@ tic@@ les . 
and that is why the tes@@ tes rele@@ ase tes@@ to@@ stero@@ ne at the fe@@ tal stage . 
but because this individual la@@ cks the rec@@ ep@@ tors to dete@@ ct tes@@ to@@ stero@@ ne , the body does not respond to the tes@@ to@@ stero@@ ne . 
and that &apos;s called an and@@ ro@@ gen rec@@ ep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct . 
so much tes@@ to@@ stero@@ ne , but no reaction to it . 
as a consequ@@ ence , the body evol@@ ves more in line with the typical female pattern . 
when the child is born , it looks like a girl . 
she is a girl . she is educ@@ ated as a girl . 
but it usually las@@ ts until she reach@@ es pu@@ ber@@ ty and her brea@@ sts grow and develop , but she does not get her period until someone comes to the conclu@@ sion that there is something different here . 
and they do a few tests and find out that instead of eg@@ gs and u@@ ter@@ us , they actually carry tes@@ tic@@ les and that they have a chromo@@ some . 
it is important to understand that this person might actually be male , but they are not really . 
women , like men , have something in our bodies called ad@@ ren@@ ali@@ ne gl@@ ands . 
they are in the back part of our body . 
and the ad@@ ren@@ als produce and@@ ro@@ gens , which are vir@@ ili@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es . 
most women , like me - i think being a typical woman - i do not know my actual chromo@@ some construction , but i think i probably have the most typical - most women like me actually respond to and@@ ro@@ geni@@ c . 
we produce and@@ ro@@ gen and we respond to and@@ ro@@ gens . 
the result is that someone like me actually has a brain that was more and@@ ro@@ geni@@ c than a woman who was born with tes@@ tic@@ les and has an and@@ ro@@ gen rec@@ ep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct . 
sex is really compli@@ cat@@ ed@@ ; inter@@ sexu@@ als are not only in the middle of the gender spectrum - in a sense , they can be spread across the entire band@@ wid@@ th@@ , 
another exam@@ ple@@ : a few years ago , i received a call from a 19@@ -year-old man who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , lived as a man , and he had just found out that he was had o@@ vari@@ es and a u@@ ter@@ us . 
he had an extreme form of a con@@ geni@@ tal ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical hyper@@ bol@@ e . 
he has x@@ x chromo@@ some@@ s , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ als were so active that they essentially created a male hor@@ mon@@ e environment . 
and as a consequ@@ ence , his geni@@ tal@@ s became mas@@ cul@@ ine , his brain ex@@ posed to the more typical male part of the hor@@ mon@@ al spectrum . 
and when he was born he looked like a boy - no one su@@ spec@@ ted anything . 
and only when he turned 19 did he get enough medical problems , in fact because he intern@@ ally men@@ stru@@ ated , that the doctors found out that he was female inside . 
okay , just a quick example of a vari@@ ant of inter@@ sex . 
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ some@@ s develop something called o@@ vot@@ esti@@ s , where o@@ vari@@ an tissue is en@@ cas@@ ed in tes@@ tic@@ ular tissue . 
we do not know exactly why that happens . 
so sex can occu@@ r in many different ways . 
the reason why children with this type of body - be it adult or si@@ am@@ ese twi@@ ns or inter@@ sex - is often adap@@ ted to the standard by surge@@ ons is not because it would be bene@@ ficial to their physical health . 
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy . 
the reason why they often under@@ go various types of sur@@ gical interven@@ tion is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories . 
our system is typically based on the idea that a particular an@@ atom@@ ical form is associated with a particular identity . 
so we have the concept of being a woman means having a female identi@@ ty@@ ; being a black person is said to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in view of your own story . 
so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea . 
and when we are con@@ fron@@ ted with a body that really is something very different for us , it conf@@ uses us in terms of those categ@@ ori@@ zations . 
so we have a lot of roman@@ tic ideas about individu@@ alism in our culture . 
and our nation is really based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism . 
now you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling it is when children are born who are two person@@ s in one bo@@ dy@@ , 
where lat@@ ely i had the most exc@@ it@@ ement was the south african run@@ ner cas@@ ter se@@ men@@ ya last year whose gender was questi@@ oned at the lei@@ cha@@ t@@ let@@ hi@@ k world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship in ber@@ lin . 
many journ@@ alists called me with the questi@@ on@@ : &quot; what test will you do that tells us whether cas@@ ter se@@ men@@ ya is female or mal@@ e@@ ? &quot; 
and i had to explain to journ@@ alists that this test does not exist . 
we now know that sex is complicated enough , that we have to ad@@ mit that for us nature does not draw a line between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex@@ ; in the main we are the ones who pre@@ tend that divi@@ ding line as natural . 
so we have such a situation where , as our science pro@@ gr@@ esses , we have to ac@@ knowledge all the more that these categ@@ ories , which we have considered to be stable an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories , which produced very simple associ@@ ations to create las@@ ting identity categ@@ ories , are much blu@@ r@@ red as we assu@@ med . 
and that &apos;s not just about sex . 
it also appli@@ es to race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology has allowed . 
in our consi@@ der@@ ations , we get into all sorts of un@@ comfortable areas . 
for example , we come across the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es . 
what should we do with the fact that we diff@@ er from them only by a few nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide@@ s@@ ? 
as we continue to advan@@ ce our science , we are increasingly enter@@ ing a zone of dis@@ comfort where we must ac@@ knowledge that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories we had were all too simpli@@ stic . 
we see this in all possible areas of human life . 
one of the areas in which we see this , for example , in our culture today , in today &apos;s united states , are the strug@@ gles over the beginning and the end of life . 
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about the point at which a body becomes human , so that it has another right than the fe@@ tal life . 
no@@ wa@@ days , we have very difficult argu@@ ments - perhaps not as public as in medicine - about the question of when someone is dead . 
our ance@@ stors never used to struggle with the question of when someone was dead . 
at most , they held someone under their no@@ ses , and if they moved , they have not yet bu@@ ried them . 
if she stopped moving , she was bu@@ ried . 
but today we find ourselves in a situation where we want to re@@ move people &apos;s vi@@ tal organs and transplan@@ t them to other people . 
and as a result we get caught up in the fight with the really tough question of when someone is dead . and that puts us in a really difficult position where we do not have as simple categ@@ ories as we used to . 
now you might think that the whole break@@ down of categ@@ ories would really make someone like me happy . 
i am politi@@ cally pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i defen@@ d people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit , it makes me nervous . 
to realize that these categ@@ ories are really much more inse@@ cure than we thought makes me ten@@ se . 
and it makes me ten@@ se with reg@@ ard to consi@@ der@@ ations concern@@ ing democracy . 
so to tell you about this ten@@ sion , i have to conf@@ ess first that i &apos;m a big fan of foun@@ ding fa@@ thers . 
i know they were ra@@ cis@@ t , i know they were sex@@ ists , but they were great . 
i think they were so bra@@ ve and strong and so radical in what they did that every couple of years i catch sight of the lu@@ mp@@ y musical 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten . 
it is because of what happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers . 
in my opini@@ on , the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers were the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and that is why . 
what they re@@ je@@ cted was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and they re@@ placed it with another that was radical and beautiful , and that was relevant to us for 200 years . 
as you all remember , our foun@@ ding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y . and the mon@@ arch@@ y was based on a very simpli@@ fied concept of an@@ atom@@ y . 
the rul@@ ers of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the right of birth . 
they had a blue blood concept . 
they were of the opini@@ on that people who had political power should have this political power because of the in@@ her@@ ited blo@@ od@@ line from grand@@ father to father to son and so on . 
the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted this idea and re@@ placed it with a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and that concept said that all men were created equal . 
they le@@ vel@@ ed the playing field and decided that , an@@ atom@@ ically speaking , the simil@@ ari@@ ties did not count the differences . and that was very radical . 
now they did that because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system in which two things grew together . 
democracy was growing , but at the same time science was also growing . 
if you look at the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers &apos; story , it becomes clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ ali@@ stic world . 
they went away from explan@@ ations of a super@@ natural nature , re@@ je@@ cting things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where the trans@@ fer is based on a very vag@@ ue concept of birth right . 
they moved towards a natur@@ ali@@ stic concept . 
and when you look at the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , for example , you talk about nature and the god of nature . 
they do not talk about god and the nature of god . 
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are . 
and as part of that they gave us a concept of an@@ atom@@ ical simil@@ ari@@ ties . 
and with that , they have wonder@@ fully prepared the future civil rights movement . 
they did not think so , but what they did for us was great . 
so what happened next ye@@ ar@@ ? 
for example , women who sou@@ ght the right to vote , the concept of foun@@ ding fa@@ thers , who says an@@ atom@@ ical toge@@ ther@@ ness is more important than the an@@ atom@@ ical difference , and said , &quot; that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ vari@@ es is not significant enough as a difference that we do not should have the right to the right to full citi@@ zen@@ ship , to own the right property , etc , etc . &quot; 
and women argu@@ ed that success@@ fully . 
next came the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like so@@ journ@@ er truth , who spoke about it , &quot; am i not a wom@@ an@@ ? &quot; 
we find men mar@@ ching in the ran@@ ks of the civil rights movement who say , &quot; i am a man . &quot; 
again , people of different skin color who rely on an@@ atom@@ ical simil@@ ari@@ ties before an@@ atom@@ ical differences , again , succe@@ ed . 
we see the same in the dis@@ ability rights movement . 
of course , the problem is that as we begin to look at all the simil@@ ari@@ ties , we must begin to question why we main@@ tain certain separ@@ ations . 
now , mind you , i want to main@@ tain certain divi@@ sions , an@@ atom@@ ically speaking , in our culture . 
for example , i do not want to give a fish the same rights as a human being . 
i do not want to say that we should completely distance ourselves from the an@@ atom@@ y . 
i do not want to say that 5 year ol@@ ds should have the right to give their con@@ sent to sex or to mar@@ ry . 
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical divi@@ sions that make sense to me , and which i think we should keep . 
but the challenge is to find out who they are and why we keep them and if they make sense . 
so let &apos;s get back to those two beings who were conc@@ ei@@ ved at the beginning of the lec@@ ture . 
we have two beings , both in the middle of 197@@ 9 , be@@ gotten in exactly the same day . 
imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , was born pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely three months ago , so she was born on 1 jun@@ e 198@@ 0 . 
hei@@ n@@ rich , on the other hand , is born on the birth date , so he was born on 1 mar@@ ch 198@@ 0@@ , 
just because of the fact that mar@@ ia was born three months early , she ga@@ ins all possible rights three months before hei@@ n@@ rich - to have the right con@@ sen@@ su@@ al sex , the right to choose , the right to drink . 
hei@@ n@@ rich has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , only because of the time of his birth . 
we find other od@@ di@@ ties reg@@ ar@@ ding what your rights are . 
hei@@ n@@ rich , assu@@ ming he is male - although i did not tell you he &apos;s the one with x@@ y - assu@@ ming he &apos;s male , he can now be confi@@ sc@@ ated , something mar@@ ia does not have to worry about . 
mar@@ ia , on the other hand , can not exercise the same rights in all feder@@ al states that hei@@ n@@ rich has in all states , and indeed the right to mar@@ ry . 
hei@@ n@@ rich can mar@@ ry a woman in every state , but today mar@@ ia can only mar@@ ry a woman in a few states . 
so we have these perman@@ ent an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that are in many respe@@ cts proble@@ matic and questi@@ on@@ able . 
and for me , the question ari@@ se@@ s@@ : what will we do as our science makes such progress in an@@ atom@@ y that we reach a point where we have to ad@@ mit that a democracy based on an@@ atom@@ y could fall ap@@ art@@ ? 
i do not want to give up science , but at the same time it sometimes feels like science is becoming self-@@ reli@@ ant . 
where are we go@@ ing@@ ? 
it seems that our culture takes on a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic att@@ it@@ u@@ de@@ : &quot; well , we have to draw a line somewhere , so we draw it somewhere &quot; 
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position . 
so , for example , at one point texas decided that mar@@ rying a man means you do not have a y chromo@@ some , and mar@@ rying a woman means you have a y chromo@@ some . 
now , in practice , people are not being tes@@ ted for their chromo@@ some@@ s . 
but it is also very bizar@@ re , because of the story i first told them about the and@@ ro@@ gen rec@@ ep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct . 
if we look at one of the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , d@@ r . martin lu@@ ther king , he off@@ ers us in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; a kind of solution . 
he says that we should not treat people according to &quot; their skin color , but according to the property of their character &quot; jud@@ ge , and so goes beyond an@@ atom@@ y . 
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot; 
but how do you do that in practic@@ e@@ ? 
how do you jud@@ ge people based on their %characteristics? 
i would also like to point out that i am not sure that we should distribu@@ te human rights in such a way because i have to ad@@ mit that i know a number of gold@@ en re@@ trie@@ vers who are likely to ear@@ n social benefits rather than some i know . 
i &apos;d like to say that i probably also know some bright lab@@ rad@@ or dogs who are more capable of making more infor@@ med , smar@@ ter , and mat@@ ure decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds i know . 
so how should we oper@@ a@@ tion@@ alize the question about the properties of the charac@@ ter@@ ? 
it turns out to be really difficult . 
and a part of me wonder@@ s what if the content of a person@@ ality was something that would be %machine-readable in the future - could be visu@@ alized using f@@ mr@@ i@@ ? 
do we really want to go in this direc@@ tion@@ ? 
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going . 
what i know is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the usa is the leader in thinking about issues of democracy . 
in our que@@ st for democracy , we have done our job really well , and i think we would do well in the future . 
we do not have the situation , as is the case in iran , for example , where a man sexu@@ ally attra@@ cted to other men is pun@@ ished with death unless he is ready to under@@ go gender reas@@ sign@@ ment , in which case he may stay alive . 
conditions of this kind do not exist with us . 
i am gla@@ d to say that we do not have these conditions - a surgeon whom i spoke with a few years ago , who had brought along a pair of si@@ am@@ ese twi@@ ns to separate them , in part to make a name for themselves . 
but when i pho@@ ned him and asked him why he made these interven@@ tions - they were high-@@ risk oper@@ ations - his response was that in his country , those kids would be treated very ba@@ dly , and so he had to do it . 
i ans@@ wer@@ ed him , &quot; now you have considered political as@@ yl@@ um rather than an operation to separate it@@ ? &quot; 
the united states offer incredible opportunities to allow people to be who they are without having to change for the sa@@ ke of the state . 
that &apos;s why i think we have to be leaders . 
well , just to finish , i &apos;d like to say that i talked a lot about the fa@@ thers . 
and i would like to think about the possibilities democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more mothers involved . 
and i want to say something that is a bit radical to a fe@@ mini@@ st , and i think that there could be different types of insi@@ ghts that come from different types of an@@ atom@@ y , especially when people use group thinking . 
for years , because i was interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i was also interested in research on gender differences . 
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world . 
what we have learned from cros@@ s-@@ cultural studies is that women , on average - not every , but on average - are more likely to pay close attention to complex social relationships and car@@ ing for people who are vulnerable within the group . 
and therefore , when we think about it we have an interesting situation ahead of us . 
years ago , when i was doing post@@ graduate studies , one of my super@@ vis@@ ors who knew my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism asked me - i consider myself a fe@@ mini@@ st , so it still does - a really pe@@ cul@@ i@@ ar question . 
he said , &quot; tell me what fe@@ mini@@ ne fe@@ mini@@ ne is . &quot; 
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stu@@ pi@@ dest question i &apos;ve ever heard . 
fe@@ min@@ ism is about elimin@@ ating cli@@ ch@@ é@@ s about gender , so fe@@ min@@ ism is not fe@@ mini@@ ne . 
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought that there could be something fe@@ mini@@ ne in fe@@ min@@ ism . 
that is to say , there could be something , on average , that distin@@ gui@@ she@@ s female brains from male ones , which makes us more atten@@ tive to highly complex social relationships , and more atten@@ tive to car@@ ing for the vulnerable . 
so , if the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers were extremely war@@ y of figu@@ ring out how individuals could be prote@@ cted from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we brought more mothers into that concept , we &apos;d get more concep@@ tu@@ ally , not just how to protect , but how we could protect each other can provide . 
and maybe that &apos;s where we have to go in the future , if we &apos;re going to bring democracy beyond an@@ atom@@ y - less thinking about the individual body in terms of identity , and thinking more about relationships . 
so if we try to make a more perfect connection as a people , we think about what we can do for each other . 
many thanks . 
i &apos;m jes@@ s@@ i and this is my su@@ it@@ case . 
but before i show them what i have in them , i will make a very public conf@@ ession , and that is@@ : i am obs@@ essed with out@@ fit@@ s . 
i love to find , wear , and lat@@ ely take pictures and blog@@ ging for every occasi@@ on , a color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit . 
but i do not buy anything new . 
i get all my clo@@ the@@ s secon@@ d-@@ hand on fle@@ a markets and in secon@@ d-@@ hand sho@@ ps . 
o@@ oh , thank you . 
secon@@ d-@@ hand sho@@ pping allows me to reduce the impact of my war@@ dro@@ be on the environment and also on my pur@@ se . 
i meet all kinds of great peop@@ le@@ ; my dollars usually serve a good pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ; i look pretty uni@@ que@@ ; and it makes sho@@ pping my very own tre@@ as@@ ure hun@@ t . 
i mean , what will i find to@@ da@@ y@@ ? 
will it be my si@@ ze@@ ? 
will i like the color@@ ? 
will it cost less than $ 20@@ ? 
if all the answers are yes , i feel as if i have won . 
i &apos;ll come back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell them what i &apos;ve pac@@ ked here at ted for this exciting week . 
i mean , what does anyone bring with so many out@@ fit@@ s@@ ? 
so i &apos;ll show you exactly what i brought . 
i brought seven pa@@ irs of under@@ pants , and that &apos;s all . 
under@@ wear for exactly one week are all that i have done in my su@@ it@@ case . 
i was bet@@ ting that i would find everything else i might want to wear once i got to pal@@ m spr@@ ings . 
and since you did not hear from me as the woman walking around in her under@@ wear here at ted - that means i found some things . 
and i really want to show you my out@@ fit@@ s for this week . 
does that sound good ? 
as i do so , i will also give you some of the lessons that i believe , whether you believe it or not , that i have learned nothing new from these ad@@ vent@@ ures . 
let &apos;s start with sun@@ day . 
i call that the radi@@ ant tiger . 
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great . 
you can almost always look great for less than $ 50 . 
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket cost me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece i &apos;ve wor@@ n in all this week . 
mon@@ da@@ y@@ : color is something powerful . 
it is almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be in a bad mo@@ od wearing bright red pants . 
when you &apos;re happy , you attra@@ ct other happy people . 
tu@@ es@@ da@@ y@@ : adap@@ tation is totally over@@ rat@@ ed . 
i &apos;ve spent a lot of my life trying to be myself and ad@@ ju@@ sting at the same time . 
just be who you are . 
if you surro@@ und yourself with the right people , you will not only understand it , you will appreci@@ ate it . 
we@@ dn@@ es@@ da@@ y@@ : hu@@ g your inner child . 
sometimes people tell me i look like i &apos;m &apos;@@ ; dre@@ ss &apos;@@ ; or that i remin@@ d her of her se@@ ven@@ -year-old . 
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot; 
th@@ ur@@ s@@ da@@ y@@ : confidence is the key . 
if you think you look good in something , it &apos;s almost like that . 
and if they think that they are not looking good in something , they are probably right too . 
i grew up with a mother who taught me day by day . 
but it was only when i turned 30 that i really understood what that meant . 
and i will sum@@ mar@@ ize that for you shor@@ tly . 
if you think you are a wonderful person inside and out , then there is nothing you can not carry . 
so there is no exc@@ use for someone here in this audience . 
we should be able to rock everything we want . 
many thanks . 
fri@@ da@@ y@@ : a universal truth - five wor@@ d@@ s@@ : gold@@ en pa@@ ill@@ ets match everything . 
and finally , satur@@ da@@ y@@ : developing your own , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world about yourself without saying a word . 
it has been pro@@ ved to me time and time again , when people approach@@ ed me during this week , just because of what i wor@@ e . and i had great talks . 
obviously that will not fit in my tiny su@@ it@@ case . 
so , before i go home to bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , i will don@@ ate it all again . 
because the lesson i am trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go . 
i do not have to emotion@@ ally clin@@ g to these things , because right around the corner there will always be another crazy , color@@ ful , radi@@ ant out@@ fit that will only wait for me if i have a little love in my heart and i &apos;m looking for it . 
thank you very much . 
thank you very much . 
good day everybody . 
i have something here that i want to show you . 
think of this as a visual point , as a flying picture point . 
that &apos;s what we call per@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble design in our lab . 
let me tell you a little bit about it . 
if you take this picture now - i am origin@@ ally itali@@ an , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y grow@@ s up in his room with this picture . but the reason i am showing them this is that something very interesting happened in form@@ ul@@ a 1 over the past decades . 
some time ago , when they wanted to win a form@@ ul@@ a 1 race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car . 
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then they won the race . 
no@@ wa@@ days , when you want to win a race , you really need something like this - something that the car monit@@ ors in real time , has a few thousand sensor@@ s , trans@@ mit@@ s the information from the car , pas@@ ses that information on to the system and then processes it they then use this to send back decisions to this car and change things in real time while information is colle@@ cted . 
in engineering teams , you would call this a real@@ -@@ time control system . 
and basically , it &apos;s a system that consi@@ sts of two parts - a sen@@ sing part and a re@@ acting part . 
what is interesting these days is the real@@ -@@ time control systems starting to emer@@ ge in our lives . 
our cities have just been equi@@ pped with networks and electro@@ ni@@ cs in the last few years . 
you become a computer out@@ do@@ ors . 
and as computers in the open , they begin to respond in other ways , they are percei@@ ved and driven . 
when we make cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal . 
by the way , i would like to mention that cities are only two percent of the surface of the earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there . 
they account for 75 percent of energy consumption - caus@@ ing up to 80 percent of co2 emissions . 
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal . 
beyond the cities , all of this sen@@ ses and dri@@ ves into objects of daily life . 
this is from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ one@@ ll@@ i organi@@ zes for mom@@ a later in the year , during the summer . 
it means , &quot; talk to me . &quot; 
well , all our objects , our environment , are beginning to speak back to us . 
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om out there becomes both a sen@@ sor and a driver . 
and that radi@@ cally changes the interaction we humans have with our environment outside . 
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mi@@ che@@ lang@@ el@@ o . . . 
do you know , when mi@@ che@@ lang@@ el@@ o sha@@ ped the mo@@ ses , it is said that he took the ham@@ mer in the end and thre@@ w it on mo@@ ses - in fact , you can still see a small spot underneath - and said , called , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é no@@ n par@@ l@@ i , why are you talking not ? &quot; 
now , today , our environment is beginning to respond to us for the very first time . 
i will just show you some examples - again , with the idea to percei@@ ve our environment and to drive . 
let us begin to percei@@ ve . 
now the first project that i would like to introduce to you is in truth one of the first of our laboratory . 
it was born in it@@ al@@ y four and a half years ago . 
and what we did was actually use a new kind of network that was used around the world - that &apos;s a mobile phone network - and to use anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ gat@@ ed information from that network , which is colle@@ cted anyway by the oper@@ ator to understand how the city works . 
the summer was a happy summer - 2006 . 
it was when it@@ al@@ y won the world cu@@ p . 
some of them will remember , it was when it@@ al@@ y played against fran@@ ce , and then in the end zi@@ dan@@ e , the head bu@@ tt . 
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y has won in the end 
now look at what happened on that day , just watching the activity happening in the network . 
here you can see the city . 
in the middle you can see the col@@ is@@ eu@@ m , the river ti@@ ber . 
in the morning , before the game . 
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine above . 
early after@@ noon , people here and there making calls and moving . 
the game begins - to be sil@@ ent . 
fran@@ ce makes a gate . it@@ al@@ y makes a goal . 
hal@@ f-@@ time , people make a short call , go to rest@@ room . 
second hal@@ f@@ time . end of normal playing time . 
first exten@@ sion , second . 
zi@@ dan@@ e , in an inst@@ ant the head@@ -@@ bu@@ tt . 
it@@ al@@ y win@@ s . yeah . 
now , this night , everyone went to the center to celebra@@ te . 
they saw the big difference . 
the next day , everyone went to the center to meet the win@@ ning team and the prime minister at the same time . 
and then everyone went down@@ sta@@ irs . 
you will see the image of the cir@@ co massi@@ mo square , where , since ro@@ man times , people have come to celebra@@ te - to have a great party and they see the end of the day . 
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way we did not manage a few years ago . 
another example of feeling for quick@@ : this is not about people , but about things that we use and consum@@ e . 
well , no@@ wa@@ days we know everything about where our things come from . 
this is a card that shows you all the chi@@ ps that make up a ma@@ c computer , how they came together . 
but we know very little about where things are going . 
so in this project , we actually designed some small marke@@ rs to track the gar@@ bag@@ e as it goes through the system . 
so we started with some volunte@@ ers who helped us a little over a year ago in se@@ attle to mark the things they thre@@ w away - different kinds of things , as you can see - things they would throw away anyway . 
then we gl@@ u@@ ed the little chi@@ ps , the little tag@@ s , on the gar@@ bag@@ e and started to track him . 
here are the results we have just received . 
from se@@ attle . . . 
after a week . 
with this information we realized that there are a lot of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies in the system . 
we can indeed do the same things with less energy . 
the data was not available before . 
but a lot of use@@ less transpor@@ ts and complicated things happen . 
but the other thing is that we believe that every day we see that the cu@@ p we throw away does not just disappe@@ ar , that it is still somewhere on the planet . 
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day is still there . 
and if we showed that to people , then we can drive a change of behavior . 
so that &apos;s the reason for this project . 
my collea@@ gue , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , could tell you much more about this and the many other wonderful things you can do with it , but i would like to come to the second part that we discus@@ sed at the beginning and that is the activity of our environment . 
and the first project is something we did a few years ago in zar@@ ag@@ o@@ za , spa@@ in . 
it started with a question from the may@@ or who came to us saying that spa@@ in and southern europe have a nice tradition of using water as a part of architecture in public places . 
and the question was@@ : how could one connect technology , new technology with it@@ ? 
and one of the ideas that were identifi@@ ed with in a work@@ group was , imagine these ho@@ ses , and val@@ ves , sol@@ en@@ o@@ id val@@ ves , fla@@ ps that open and close . 
they cause something like a water cur@@ tain with picture points of water . 
if these pi@@ x@@ els fall off , you can write on them , you can view patterns , pictures , text . 
and they can approach him and he will open up to let them jump through , as you can see in this picture . 
well , we pres@@ ented the may@@ or bel@@ lo@@ ch . 
he really liked it . 
and we got the order to design a building at the ent@@ ran@@ ce of the exp@@ o . 
we called it the digital water pa@@ vili@@ on . 
the whole building was water . 
there are no do@@ ors or windows , but when they approach , it will open and let them in . 
the roof was also covered with water . 
and if it &apos;s wind@@ y , if you want to reduce the sp@@ las@@ h , you can even lower the roof . 
or you could close the building and the whole architecture will , as in this case , you know , these days , when you shu@@ t down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they destro@@ yed the building .@@ &quot; ; 
no , they did not destro@@ y the building , it &apos;s just that the architecture almost disappe@@ ars . 
here you can see how the building works . 
you see the person wonder@@ ing what &apos;s going on inside . 
and here you can see me trying not to get we@@ t when testing the sensor@@ s that opened the water . 
well , i should tell them what happened one night when all the sensor@@ s stopped working . 
but actually it was even more fun that night . 
all children from zar@@ ag@@ o@@ za came to the building because the way they played with the building was very different . 
no longer a building that would open to let you in , but a building that still had break@@ s and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting we@@ t . 
and that was very exciting for us , because as architec@@ ts , engineers , designers , we always think about how people use the things we design . 
but the reality is always un@@ predi@@ ct@@ able . 
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and inter@@ acting with people . 
here is a picture of the building with the physical picture points , the picture points of water and the proje@@ ctions on them . 
and this is what made us think about the next project that i am showing them now . 
imagine these picture points could really start to fly . 
imagine , you could have small heli@@ cop@@ ters flying through the air , and each of them with a small image point with changing light - almost like a cloud that can move through space . 
here is the video . 
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter like the one you saw earlier , moving with others , completely in syn@@ c . 
you can have this cloud . 
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display , like this - a uni@@ form forma@@ tion in two dimensions . 
or ir@@ regular but in three dimensions , in which what changes is the light , not the position of the image points . 
you can play with different types . 
imagine the screen could easily appear in different forma@@ ts or si@@ zes , in different re@@ solutions . 
but then all that could be just a 3d cloud of picture points to which they can approach and through which they can look , from many , many direc@@ tions . 
here you can see a real fl@@ y@@ fire control that sin@@ ks down to form a uni@@ form v like before . 
when you turn on the light , it looks like this . just as we have seen before . 
imagine that each one is controlled by people . 
every single pi@@ x@@ el could have an impul@@ se coming from people , from people &apos;s movements or the like . 
i want to show you something here first of all . 
we worked with rob@@ er@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best ball@@ et dan@@ cers of our time - the é@@ toi@@ le at the met@@ rop@@ oli@@ tan theater in new york and the sc@@ ala in mil@@ an - we recor@@ ded his moves in 3d to use them as a boo@@ st for the fl@@ y@@ fire . 
here you can see rob@@ er@@ to dan@@ cing . 
on the left side you can see the picture points , the different impres@@ sions cap@@ tured . 
it &apos;s also a real@@ -@@ time 3d scan and a motion capture . 
so they can understand the whole movement . 
you can do that all the time . 
but then , once we have all the picture points , you can play with them and play with gravi@@ ta@@ tional and ro@@ ta@@ tional motion with color movement . 
we would like to use this as a possible imp@@ et@@ us for the fl@@ y@@ fire . 
i would like to show you the lat@@ est project we are working on . 
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olymp@@ ics . 
it &apos;s called the cloud - the cloud . 
again , imagine the idea that we invol@@ ve people again to do something and to change the environment - almost as we call it , building in a cloud like moving a bar@@ n door , but with a cloud . 
imagine that everyone can make a small don@@ ation for a picture point . 
i think that the not@@ able one of the events of recent years , the last decades , is that we have moved from a physical to a digital world . 
that has digit@@ i@@ zed everything , know it , and made it acc@@ essi@@ ble through the internet . 
no@@ wa@@ days , for the first time - and ob@@ ama@@ s campaign has shown - we can move from digital world , from self-@@ organi@@ zing forces of networks to physical world . 
in our case that can be that we use it to design and create a symbol . 
that is something that is built in the city . 
but tomorrow is the time to face the coming challenges - think of climate change or co2 emissions - how can we then move from the digital world to the physical . 
so the idea is that we actually invol@@ ve the people in which they do things together , colle@@ c@@ tively . 
the cloud is again a cloud of pi@@ x@@ els , in the same way as a real cloud is a cloud of particles . 
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of pi@@ x@@ els . 
it is a physical enti@@ ty in london , but covered with imag@@ ery . 
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences . 
in fact , you can look at them from below , share the key moments for olymp@@ ic 20@@ 12 and beyond , and use it as a way of connec@@ ting with the community . 
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top of it , like london &apos;s new sum@@ mit . 
they can go inside . 
and a kind of digital ligh@@ thou@@ se at night - but most importantly , a new kind of experience for those who want to go to the top . 
thank you . 
as an artist , the connection is very important to me . 
through my work i try to express that people are not separ@@ ated from nature and that everything is connected . 
the first time i was in the ant@@ arc@@ tic almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ berg@@ s . 
i felt aw@@ e . 
my heart was ra@@ cing , i was di@@ zz@@ y , trying to gras@@ p what was in front of me . 
the ic@@ e@@ berg@@ s around me stood almost 60 meters out of the water . and i could only mar@@ vel that this was a s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on another s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke , year after year . 
ic@@ e@@ berg@@ s are born as cal@@ ves of a gla@@ ci@@ er or by breaking out of ice flo@@ es . 
every ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality . 
they interact clearly with their environment and their experiences . 
some re@@ fu@@ se to give up and clin@@ g to the bit@@ ter end , while others can not stand it anymore and collapse in a fit of dra@@ matic passion . 
when looking at an ic@@ e@@ berg , it is easy to think that they are isol@@ ated , separate and alone , much as we humans often see each other . 
but the truth is far from it . 
as an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i brea@@ the in its pre@@ histor@@ ic atmosphere . 
while the ice mel@@ ts , it rele@@ ases miner@@ al-@@ rich drin@@ king water that no@@ ur@@ ish@@ es many forms of life . 
i take my pictures of these ic@@ e@@ berg@@ s as if i were portra@@ its of my ance@@ stors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that wise , and will never again exist like that . 
it is not a death when they mel@@ t@@ ; it is not an end , but a continu@@ ation of your path along the life cycle . 
part of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ berg@@ s i photograph is very young - a few thousand years old . 
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old . 
the last pictures i would like to show you , show an ic@@ e@@ berg , which i photograph@@ ed in q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q in green@@ land . 
very sel@@ dom does one actually wit@@ ness a roll@@ ing ic@@ e@@ berg . 
here you can see it now . 
on the left side you will see a small boat . 
that &apos;s about five meters long . 
please pay attention to the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it is lo@@ cated on the water@@ line . 
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is standing there . 
that &apos;s the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg . 
it prot@@ ru@@ des about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters . 
and this video is in real time . 
and just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you another side of his person@@ ality . 
thank you . 
my life is really bl@@ essed by working on some amazing projects . 
but the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy . 
his name is temp@@ t . 
temp@@ t was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artists of the 8@@ 0s . 
then , one day , he came back from running and said , &quot; pa@@ ps , my legs are tin@@ gling . &quot; 
and that was the out@@ break of the . 
temp@@ t is completely paraly@@ zed today . 
he can only use his eyes . 
i stood opposite him . 
i have a company that does design and anima@@ tion , so gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ tab@@ ly a complex part of what we ad@@ mir@@ e and respect in the art world . 
we have therefore decided to support tony - temp@@ t - and his cause . 
i met with his father and brother and said , &quot; we will give you this mon@@ e@@ y@@ , 
what are you going to do with it@@ ? &quot; 
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again . 
i just want to get back with him and i said , &quot; hang on , is not that - i &apos;ve seen ste@@ phen haw@@ king - can not all the paraly@@ zed people communicate through these de@@ vic@@ es@@ ? &quot; 
and he repli@@ ed@@ : &quot; no , only if you bel@@ ong to the higher social class and have a remarkable insu@@ ran@@ ce , can you really do that . 
normal people , these devices are not acc@@ essi@@ ble . &quot; 
and i repli@@ ed , &quot; how do you %communicate?&quot; 
does anyone have the movie &apos;@@ ; butt@@ er@@ fly and di@@ ver &apos;s bell &quot; see@@ n@@ ? 
this is how they communicate - that &apos;s how their finger@@ s run along . 
i was ast@@ oni@@ she@@ d@@ : &quot; very arch@@ ai@@ c , how can that be@@ ? &quot; 
so i came with the need to just issue a check and instead i issu@@ ed a check that i had no idea how to red@@ ee@@ m it . 
i commit@@ ted myself to place and face his brother and his father - with the wor@@ d@@ s@@ : &quot; well , my suggest@@ i@@ on is thi@@ s@@ : tony will speak , we will get him a machine and we will find a way to make his art again can . 
because it is a far@@ ce that someone who still car@@ ries all that in himself can not communicate it . &quot; 
i spoke at a conference a few months later . 
i met these people from gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then draw on it with a las@@ er poin@@ ter that regi@@ sters only the negative area . 
so they move around making art instal@@ lations like these . 
they say that all the things dis@@ played up there follow a life cycle . 
it starts with the sex parts , then comes the words of ab@@ use , then the bush sl@@ ander and last , the people actually make art . 
but there has always been a life cycle in your pres@@ ent@@ ations . 
so i went home and ate dinner with my wife and told her about everything and we thou@@ ght@@ : &quot; well , second , if there is this technology with which you can use your eyes to control things , then you should if we find a way that temp@@ t can control a las@@ er so that he can make gra@@ ff@@ iti again , that would be aw@@ es@@ ome . &quot; 
that was the beginning of the journey . 
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of back and forth from things , we have achie@@ ved some things . 
fir@@ stly , we bur@@ nt the do@@ ors of the insu@@ ran@@ ces and , in fact , got a machine for temp@@ t to communicate with - a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine . 
that was incredible . 
and he is really extremely funny - i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to him , or get an e-@@ mail , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so un@@ wor@@ thy , this guy is incredible . &quot; 
in addition , we have flo@@ wn seven program@@ mers from around the world - literally from all cor@@ ners of the world - to our home . 
my wife , my kids and i moved into the garage , and these ha@@ cker@@ s and program@@ mers and con@@ spir@@ acy theor@@ ists and an@@ archi@@ sts took over our house . 
many of our friends thought that we were du@@ m@@ b enough to do that and that we would come back and all the pictures on the walls would have given way to gra@@ ff@@ iti . 
but for over two weeks we program@@ med , we went to the beach pro@@ men@@ ade in ven@@ ice , my children were involved , my dog ​​also and we created this . 
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ writer and you can see the descri@@ ption . 
this is a cheap pair of sun@@ glas@@ ses we bought at the beach pro@@ men@@ ade of ven@@ ice , some cop@@ per wire and a few things from the hard@@ ware store and the electro@@ ni@@ cs store . 
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , dis@@ assem@@ bled it , put it on a led light and now we have a device that is free@@ ly acc@@ essi@@ ble - you can build it yourself , we provide the code for free , you can down@@ load the software for free , 
so we created a device that is completely free of restri@@ ctions . 
no insu@@ ran@@ ce can get in the wa@@ y@@ , 
also no hospital . 
every paraly@@ zed person can actually communicate or draw with his eyes alone . 
thank you . 
thank you very much , that was incredible . 
so at the end of the two weeks we went back to temp@@ ting room . 
i love this picture , because it is the room of someone else and that is his room . 
there is now all this hy@@ pe before the big reve@@ lation 
and after more than a year of planning , two weeks of program@@ ming , pas@@ ta parti@@ es , and ni@@ ghts out , tony dre@@ w for the first time in seven years . 
and that &apos;s an impres@@ sive picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system . 
we ti@@ l@@ ted his bed so he could look outside . 
we have set up a proje@@ ctor against a wall of par@@ king in front of the hospital . 
and he dre@@ w again for the first time , in the pres@@ ence of his family and friends - and one can only imagine what a feeling that was in the par@@ king lot . 
fun@@ ni@@ ly , we also had to break into the par@@ king lot , so we felt right as part of the spra@@ yer scene . 
at the end he sent us an e-@@ mail with the following cont@@ ent@@ s@@ : &quot; for the first time in seven years , i dre@@ w something . 
i have the feeling that i was pus@@ hed under water and finally someone reach@@ ed down and pulled my head up so that i could brea@@ the . &quot; 
is not that over@@ whe@@ l@@ min@@ g@@ ? 
this is something of our fight cry . 
this kee@@ ps us on the ho@@ ok and kee@@ ps us developing . 
and we still have much to improve on this device . 
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s like a magic board . 
and someone who has such arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more . 
so we &apos;re working out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger . 
since that time we have received all kinds of recogni@@ tion . 
we won a few pri@@ zes . 
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ves it . 
it all comes from our own bag@@ s . 
so the awar@@ ds were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s aw@@ es@@ ome . &quot; 
arm@@ strong tw@@ ee@@ ted about us and then , in dec@@ ember , time magazine hon@@ ore@@ d us as one of the 50 best inven@@ tions of 2010 , which was really great . 
the cool@@ est thing about it is - and this inclu@@ des the whole circle - that this ap@@ ri@@ l will be held at mo@@ ca in down@@ town los angeles , an exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets &quot; 
and there will be pretty much the tou@@ gh@@ est street art people in the world - bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fair@@ ey , ca@@ ws - all these guys will be there . 
temp@@ t will be part of the show , which is pretty crazy . 
basically , this is about me@@ : if you see something that is impossible , then make it possible . 
everything in this room was impossible - this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ writer - everything was eventually impossible . 
make it possible - they all here . 
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with auto@@ gener@@ ating technology , but i just cap@@ tured something and surro@@ unded amazing people so we could work something together . 
and every one of them should ask themselves that question every single day they notice something that needs to be done . if not now then when ? and if not me , then who@@ ? 
i thank you . 
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most read children &apos;s book auth@@ or . 
and i always tell people that i do not want to come along like a scientist . 
you can have me as a far@@ mer , or in lea@@ ther , but no one has ever cho@@ sen far@@ mer . 
today i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and reve@@ lations . 
well , an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment is usually something that you find because you dro@@ pped it somewhere . 
you walk around the block and take it as a reve@@ lation . 
this is a painting of a circle . 
one of my friends did it - richard bol@@ ing@@ broke . 
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today . 
my circle started in the six@@ ties at the high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the class fa@@ got . 
i was the one who was be@@ aten green and blue every week in the young toile@@ t until a teacher res@@ cu@@ ed my life . 
she saved my life by let@@ ting me use the toile@@ t in the teacher &apos;s room . 
she did that secre@@ t@@ ly@@ , 
she did it for three ye@@ ar@@ s@@ , 
and i had to get away from the city . 
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had $ 85 and it hit me in san francisco , california - i found a lo@@ ver - and back in the 8@@ 0s i found it important to get involved with aids organizations . 
about three or four years ago , in the middle of the night , i received a phone call from this teacher , woman post who said , &quot; i have to see her . 
i am sad that we have never met each other as adults . 
please come to o@@ hi@@ o and please come with the man i know you have found him by now . 
and i should mention that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i want you to hur@@ ry up , please . &quot; 
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and . 
we looked at her , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew she had to be in a hosp@@ ice . 
we found one for her , we brought her , and we took care of her , and we took care of her family because it was necessary 
it was something that we knew how to do . 
and just when the woman , who wanted to meet me as an adult , got to know me , she turned into a box full of ash@@ es and was put in my hands . 
what had happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle - and the reve@@ lation of which i spoke showed up . 
the reve@@ lation is that death is part of life . 
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her@@ s . 
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs . 
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d that &apos;s been mentioned so often here today . 
he needs the same - he needs , love and pleasure . and it is up to us to give these things . 
many thanks . 
imagine a big explosion as you as@@ cen@@ d to 1,000 meters . 
imagine a plane full of smo@@ ke . 
imagine an engine that could cla@@ ck , cla@@ ck , cla@@ ck , cla@@ ck , cla@@ ck , cla@@ ck , cla@@ ck . 
that sounds sc@@ ary . 
well , i had a unique place on this da@@ y@@ ; i sat on 1@@ d . 
i was the only one who could talk to the flight atten@@ dan@@ ts . 
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably caught some birds . &quot; 
the pilot had already turned the machine and we were not so far away . 
you could see manhattan . 
two minutes later , three things happened simul@@ tane@@ ously . 
the pilot ai@@ med the machine at the hu@@ d@@ son river . 
this is usually not the rou@@ te . 
he turns off the engine@@ s . 
imagine a no@@ is@@ eless plane . 
and then he said three words - the most emotion@@ less words i &apos;ve ever heard . 
he says , &quot; ready to impact &quot; 
i did not have to talk to the on-@@ board staf@@ f anymore . 
i could see it in their eyes , it was fri@@ ght@@ ening , life was over . 
i would like to share with you three things that i learned about myself that day . 
i learned that everything is different in an inst@@ ant . 
we have this life plan , we have these things we want to do in life and i thought of all the people i wanted to reach out to a hand and did not , all the fen@@ ces i wanted to mend , all the experiences i have wanted to do and never did . 
as i thought about it later , i reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed a saying , &quot; i am colle@@ cting bad win@@ es &quot; , 
because when the wine is ready and the person is there , then i open it . 
i never want to change anything in life . 
and this ur@@ gen@@ cy , this goal , has really changed my life . 
the second thing that i learned that day - and that was when we miss@@ ed the george washington bridge , pretty much - so i thought , man , there is a thing i really reg@@ re@@ t . 
i had a good life . 
in my own humanity and with my mista@@ kes , i as@@ pir@@ ed to get better at everything i tac@@ kle@@ d . 
but in my humanity i have also given my eg@@ o space . 
and i reg@@ rett@@ ed the time i had was@@ ted on meaning@@ less things , with people who mean something . 
and i thought of the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people . 
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban@@ ish negative energy from my life . 
it is not perfect , but it is much better . 
i have not argu@@ ed with my wife for two years . 
it feels great . 
i &apos;m not trying to be right any@@ mor@@ e@@ ; i choose to be happy . 
the third thing i learned - while the inner clock begins , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , . . . &quot; to count down 
you can see the water coming . 
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot; 
i do not want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know it from docum@@ entation . 
as we crash , i had this feeling , man , dying is not sc@@ ary . 
almost as if we were prepar@@ ing for our whole life . 
but it was very sad . 
i did not want to go ; i love my life . 
and this sa@@ dness really formed in one thought , nam@@ ely that i wish only one thing . 
i just wish i could see my kids growing up . 
about a month later i atten@@ ded an appe@@ ar@@ ance of my daughter - first years , not much arti@@ stic talent . . . 
. . . not yet . 
and i celebra@@ te , i cry like a little child . 
and in the world , everything made sense to me . 
i realized then , by connec@@ ting the dots , that in life it &apos;s all about being a great dad . 
more than anything , everything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father . 
i had the mira@@ cle not to die on this day . 
i received another gift , nam@@ ely to look to the future , to come back and live differently . 
my call to all who fly today is@@ : imagine , the same thing happens on your flight - please do not - but imagine it@@ ; and how would they chan@@ ge@@ ? 
what would they do that they post@@ pon@@ e because they think they are there fore@@ ver@@ ? 
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them@@ ? 
and more than anything , are you the best parents you can ever be@@ ? 
thank you . 
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is pretty simple in itself . 
we do not want iran to build the bom@@ b . 
the most important it@@ em there for the development of nuclear weapons is the ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment facili@@ ty in nat@@ anz . 
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes you see here are real@@ -@@ time control systems . 
if we succe@@ ed in com@@ promis@@ ing the systems , controll@@ ing the spee@@ ds and val@@ ves , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge . 
these gra@@ y bo@@ xes do not work with windows soft@@ war@@ e@@ ; they are based on a completely different technology . 
but if we manage to have an effective windows virus on a laptop used by a main@@ ten@@ ance engineer to con@@ figure this gra@@ y box , then we &apos;re in business . 
and that &apos;s the planning behind stu@@ x@@ net . 
so we start with a windo@@ w@@ s-@@ dro@@ pp@@ er . 
the user data are trans@@ fer@@ red to the gra@@ y box , damage the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the ira@@ ni@@ an nuclear energy program del@@ a@@ ys - order ex@@ ecu@@ ted . 
this is a child game , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
i want to tell you how we found that out . 
when we started our research on stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely un@@ known what the purpose of this constru@@ ct was . 
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated in terms of the windows part , the dro@@ pp@@ er part , it made use of coun@@ t@@ less zero day wea@@ k spo@@ ts . 
and there seemed to be something to do with those gra@@ y bo@@ xes , these real@@ -@@ time control systems . 
this caught our attention and we started a lab project in which we infe@@ cted our area with stu@@ x@@ net and exam@@ ined this constru@@ ct . 
and then something funny happened . 
stu@@ x@@ net beha@@ ved like a lab rat who did not like our che@@ ese - s@@ ni@@ ffe@@ d it , but did not want to eat it . 
that made no sense in my eyes . 
and after experiment@@ ing with different types of che@@ ese , i realized that this is a tar@@ ge@@ ted attack . 
completely focused on a specific goal . 
the dro@@ pp@@ er activ@@ ely ro@@ ams the gra@@ y box when a special confi@@ gur@@ ation is dete@@ cted . even if the special program that is trying to infe@@ ct it is running on this target . 
and if not , then stu@@ x@@ net does nothing . 
well , that really caught my interest and we started working around it , almost around the clock , because i thought well , we do not know what the goal is . 
it could be , say , a us@@ - american power plant , or a chemical plant in germany . 
so we should soon find out what the goal is . 
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code and found that it is struc@@ tured into two digital war@@ heads - one smaller and one bigger . 
and we also noticed that they were very profession@@ ally designed by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information . 
they knew all the bits and by@@ tes they needed to attack . 
you probably even knew the size of the machine oper@@ ator &apos;s sho@@ e . 
they knew everything . 
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the stu@@ x@@ net dro@@ pp@@ er is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you@@ : the pay@@ load is a science in itself . 
it &apos;s much more dem@@ anding than anything we &apos;ve ever seen . 
here you can see a part of this attack code . 
we &apos;re talking about - about 15@@ ,000 lines of code . 
looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned assem@@ ble@@ r language . 
and i want to tell you how we were able to get out of this code . 
so what we were looking for first was system function calls because we know what they are . 
and then we sear@@ ched for ti@@ mers and data structures and tried to connect them with the real world - with potential goals in the real world . 
so we needed theor@@ ies about those goals that we could prove or dis@@ prove . 
in order to establi@@ sh these theor@@ ies , we rec@@ all that it is definitely high-@@ level sa@@ bot@@ age , it must be a high-@@ quality target and most likely it is in iran because most of the infe@@ ctions were repor@@ ted there . 
well , in this area there are not several thousand goals . 
basically , it goes out to the bus@@ che@@ hr nuclear power plant and the ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment plant in nat@@ anz . 
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges and power plants from our custom@@ er base . &quot; 
and i called her and ta@@ pped her knowledge to compare her exper@@ tis@@ e with what we had found out in the code and in the data . 
and that worked very well . 
so , it was possible for us to connect the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control . 
the ro@@ tor is this moving part inside the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object you see . 
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , then you are actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor and finally even make the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de . 
what we also found out is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it slow and sin@@ is@@ ter - obviously in an attemp@@ t to make main@@ ten@@ ance engineers des@@ pair , so they would not be able to figure it out quickly . 
the big digital war@@ head - we got an insi@@ ght by looking very clo@@ sely at data and data structures . 
so , for example , the number 16@@ 4 stands out very much from this co@@ de@@ ; you can not miss it . 
i began to work through scientific liter@@ ature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are built in nat@@ ance and found out that they are struc@@ tured in so-@@ called cas@@ ca@@ des , and each cas@@ ca@@ de con@@ tains 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges . 
so that made sense , it mat@@ ched . 
and it got even better . 
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in iran are divi@@ ded into 15 so-@@ called levels . 
and guess what we found in the attack co@@ de@@ ? 
an almost identi@@ cal structure . 
so again , that fit really well together . 
and this gave us great confidence for what we studied here . 
well , do not get me wrong , it just did not work that way . 
these results were achie@@ ved through several weeks of hard work . 
and often we just ran into a dead end and had to re@@ group . 
in any case , we found out that both digital war@@ heads were actually head@@ ing for the same goal , but from different direc@@ tions . 
the little war@@ head takes over a cas@@ ca@@ de and over@@ -@@ ro@@ tat@@ es and slow@@ s down the ro@@ tors , and the big war@@ head inter@@ acts with six cas@@ ca@@ des to manipu@@ late val@@ ves . 
so , by and large , we are very confi@@ dent that we have actually determin@@ ed what the goal is . 
it is natural and it is only natural . 
so we do not have to worry about other dest@@ in@@ ations being hit by stu@@ x@@ net . 
here is something really cool stuff that we discovered - really kno@@ cked me off my feet . 
down there is the gra@@ y box , and on top of it you can see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge . 
well , what causes this thing is that it inter@@ cep@@ ts the in@@ coming values ​​of sensor@@ s - such as pressure sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tion sensor@@ s - and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ mate code that still run@@ s during the attack , with in@@ accu@@ rate in@@ coming data . 
and indeed , this wrong in@@ boun@@ d data from stu@@ x@@ net has already been recor@@ ded . 
so it &apos;s the same as in hollywood movies , where during the cha@@ se the sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance camera is fe@@ d with previ@@ ously recor@@ ded video foot@@ age . 
that &apos;s cool , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
the idea here is obviously not just out@@ smar@@ ting the machine oper@@ ators in the control room . 
in fact it is much more dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve . 
the idea is to out@@ smart a digital security system . 
we need digital security systems where a human oper@@ ator can not re@@ act fast enough . 
in a power plant , for example , when the large ste@@ am tur@@ bine gets too fast , re@@ lief val@@ ves must be opened within milli@@ seconds . 
of course , this can not be done by a human machine oper@@ ator . 
so at this point we need digital security systems . 
and when they are en@@ danger@@ ed , really bad things can happen . 
the power plant can explo@@ de . 
and nei@@ ther the machine oper@@ ator , nor the security system will notice . 
that &apos;s sc@@ ary . 
but it gets worse . 
and what i am saying now is very important . 
think about it . this attack is gener@@ ic . 
he has nothing specifically to do with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment . 
so , for example , it would work just as well - in a power plant or in an automo@@ bile factory . 
it is gener@@ ic . 
and you do not have to - as the attac@@ ker - you do not have to attac@@ h the us@@ ability data via a us@@ b@@ -@@ stick , as we have seen with stu@@ x@@ net . 
you could also use ordinary wor@@ m technology to spread . 
you just have to spread it as much as possible . 
and when you do that , you finally get a cy@@ ber mass destruction wea@@ pon . 
that &apos;s the consequ@@ ence we have to face . 
so , unfortunately , the largest number of tar@@ gets for such attac@@ ks is not in the middle east . 
they are lo@@ cated in the united states , in europe and japan . 
so all these green areas , these are the most tar@@ ge@@ ted environments . 
we have to face the consequences and we better prepar@@ e ourselves . 
thank you . 
i have a question . 
ra@@ l@@ ph , it was repor@@ ted a lot that people su@@ spec@@ t that the mo@@ ss@@ ad is the main organization behind it . 
is that your opini@@ on@@ ? 
okay , you really want to know th@@ at@@ ? 
yes . okay . 
in my opini@@ on , the mo@@ ss@@ ad is involved , but the driving force is not israel . 
so the driving force behind it is cy@@ ber super@@ mach@@ t . 
there is only one and these are the united states - fortunately , fortunately . 
otherwise our problem would be even bigger . 
thank you for sc@@ ared the hell out of us . thanks ra@@ l@@ ph . 
i &apos;ve spent the last few years putting myself in situations that are usually very difficult and somehow dangerous . 
i went to prison - difficult . 
i worked in a coal mine - dangerous . 
i film@@ ed in war zon@@ es - difficult and dangerous . 
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this - fun in the beginning , a bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end . 
in fact , most of my career has been ex@@ posed to horri@@ fic situations , all in an effort to investi@@ gate social issues in a way that is cap@@ tiv@@ ating and interesting , and hopefully in a way that makes them enter@@ tain@@ ing and enter@@ tain@@ ing acc@@ essi@@ ble . 
so knowing that i would come here to look at the world of bran@@ ding and spon@@ sor@@ ing in a ted@@ talk , i knew that i would do something a little different . 
some of you may have heard that i post@@ ed an ad on e@@ bay a few weeks ago . 
i sent a few facebook news , some twitter mess@@ ages , and gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights on my 20@@ 11 ted@@ talk . 
really , some lucky people and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit , got the one-@@ time opportunity - cause i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never let that happen again - buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re about to see who at the time nei@@ ther had a ti@@ tle nor much content and did not give much indi@@ cation of what the top@@ ic would actually be . 
so what you got was the follo@@ win@@ g@@ : your name pres@@ ented her@@ e@@ : my ted@@ talk , of which you have no idea what the top@@ ic will be , and who could fly them around your ear@@ s depen@@ ding on the content , especially if i have your company for your participa@@ tion stupid could stand . 
but apart from that , it is a very good media opportunity . 
do you know how many people view these ted@@ tal@@ k@@ s@@ ? 
a whole lot . 
by the way , that &apos;s just the working ti@@ tle . 
despite this war@@ ning , i knew that someone would buy the name rights . 
if you had asked me this a year ago , i would not have been able to tell you this with certain@@ ty . 
but in the new project i am working on , my new film , we are explor@@ ing the world of marketing , adverti@@ sing . 
as i said , over the years i have gone into some pretty horri@@ ble situations , but nothing could prepar@@ e me , nothing could prepar@@ e me to go into anything so difficult and so dangerous as to go with these types into a room . 
you know , i had the idea for a movie . 
what i want to do is a film about product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the whole movie is finan@@ ced by product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing . 
and the movie becomes &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; be called . 
what in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; what happens is that everything , from top to bottom , from the beginning to the end , is completely bran@@ ded - by the ti@@ tle spon@@ sor you &apos;ll see in the movie , that &apos;s the x mark . 
now this brand , the qua@@ l@@ com@@ m stad@@ ium , the sta@@ ples center . . . 
these people will be et@@ ern@@ ally connected to the film - forever . 
and so the film will explore this whole idea - that &apos;s what@@ ? in et@@ ern@@ ity , fore@@ ver@@ ? 
i am a red@@ und@@ ant person . 
that was more to emp@@ has@@ ize . 
it was &quot; in et@@ ern@@ ity , forever . &quot; 
but we will not only have the brand x as the ti@@ tle spon@@ sor , but we will make sure that we will sell every possible categ@@ ory in the film . 
so maybe we &apos;ll sell a sho@@ e and he &apos;ll be the greatest sho@@ e you &apos;ve ever wor@@ n . . . 
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever driven out of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , an attention from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; , 
so the idea is , apart from showing that bran@@ ds are a part of life , actually getting them to fund the film@@ ? 
and we actually show the whole process of how it works . 
the goal of the whole film is transpar@@ ency . 
you will see the whole thing in the film . 
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole movie , from beginning to end . 
and i would be happy if ce@@ g helped to make this happen . 
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate respect for the audience . 
i do not know how rec@@ ep@@ tive people will be . 
do you have a perspective - i do not want &quot; perspective &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation - but do you know how that will evol@@ ve@@ ? 
how much money is needed to realize th@@ at@@ ? 
1.@@ 5 million . 
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth talking about some really well-@@ known bran@@ ds . 
who knows , when the movie comes out , we might look like a hor@@ de of i@@ dio@@ ts . 
what do you think the answer will be@@ ? 
the answer is most likely &quot; no &quot; be . 
but is it a difficult thing because of the film or a difficult thing because of me@@ ? 
j@@ k@@ : both . 
. . . that means , not so optimis@@ tic . 
so , my lo@@ rd , can you help me@@ ? i need help . 
i can help . 
okay . 
fantastic . 
we have to think about which bran@@ ds . 
yes . 
when you look at the people they are dealing with . . . 
there are some places we can turn to . 
turn off the camera . 
i thought , &quot; turn off the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to have a background conversation . 
it turned out that in reality it meant &quot; we do not want to have anything to do with her film &quot; 
and just like that , all these companies disappe@@ ared , one after the other . 
no one wanted to have anything to do with the film . 
i was surprised . 
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with the project . 
and i was conf@@ used because i thought the whole idea of ​​adverti@@ sing being to sho@@ w@@ case your product to as many people as possible would make it as human as possible . 
especially in today &apos;s world , at this interface of new and old media and the frag@@ mented media landscape - it is not the idea to be in this new exciting medi@@ ation tool that brings this message to the mas@@ ses . 
no , that was what i thought . 
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a fa@@ tal fla@@ w , and that was the following . 
actually no , that was not the fau@@ lt at all . 
that would not have been a problem at all . 
that would have been okay . 
but what this picture stands for is a problem . 
see , if you enter transpar@@ ency in the google search this is - this is one of the first images that po@@ ps up . 
i really like your style , ser@@ ge@@ y bri@@ n . now . 
that was the proble@@ m@@ : transpar@@ ency - free of del@@ usi@@ on and de@@ ception , easy to discover and see through@@ ; immediately under@@ stand@@ ab@@ le@@ ; characteri@@ zed by visi@@ bility and access to information , especially as far as business practic@@ es are concerned , the last line is certainly the biggest problem . 
you know , we are currently hearing a great deal about transpar@@ ency . 
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our co@@ s say so . 
but when it comes to the point that it should be imple@@ mented , something changes . 
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is sc@@ ary - like that strange bear who still ro@@ ars . 
it &apos;s un@@ predi@@ ct@@ able - like this weird country road . 
and she is also very ris@@ ky . 
what else is ri@@ sky@@ ? 
eating a whole bow@@ l of cool whi@@ p . 
that is very ris@@ ky . 
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story . 
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot; 
you see , when i was a kid and my dad caught me lying - and there he si@@ ts and looks at me with that look - he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versi@@ ons of each story . 
there is your version , there is my version , and there is the true version . &quot; 
so you see , with this movie we wanted to tell the true version . 
but since only one company , one agen@@ cy was willing to help us - and that only because i know john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ she@@ n@@ baum for years - i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to by@@ pass the middle man and go directly to the companies with my team . 
so what you suddenly started to understand - or what i started to understand - was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of ​​how your brand is understood is a big problem . 
i have friends making big , gigan@@ tic hollywood movies and i have friends making small independent movies like me . 
and my friends , who make big , gigan@@ tic hollywood films , say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partner@@ s they have . 
and then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compe@@ te with those big , gigan@@ tic hollywood movi@@ es@@ ? &quot; 
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot; 
so how exactly will we see ban in the movi@@ e@@ ? 
whenever i am on my way , and whenever i open the medicine cu@@ p@@ board , you will see you are de@@ od@@ or@@ ant . 
and every time i intervie@@ we someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this intervie@@ w@@ ? 
are you ready ? they look a little nervous . 
i want to help you to cal@@ m down . 
so maybe you should hang up a bit before the interview . &quot; 
and then we offer one of those great scen@@ ts . 
either &quot; flo@@ ral fusion &quot; or a &quot; para@@ dis@@ e wind@@ s &quot; , you will have the choice . 
we will be equi@@ pped for both men and women - hard , roll@@ -@@ on , or a stick , whatever . 
that &apos;s the short version . 
now i can answer all your questions and give you a su@@ it@@ able version . 
we are a smaller brand . 
as you have talked about the smaller films , we are a challen@@ ger as a brand . 
so we do not have such a budget as other bran@@ ds . 
to do such things - you know , remin@@ ds people of ban - that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested . 
what words would you use to describe ban@@ ? 
ban is na@@ ked . 
that &apos;s a great question . 
wom@@ an@@ : super@@ ior technology . 
technology is not the way you should describe something that somebody does . 
we speak of bol@@ d , fresh . 
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that makes this categ@@ ory really positive , unlike &quot; com@@ bat@@ s od@@ or and mo@@ is@@ ture . &quot; 
it kee@@ ps you fresh . 
how can we keep them fresh longer - better fresh , more fresh , three times fres@@ her . 
such things have a more positive effect . 
and that &apos;s a milli@@ on-@@ dollar company . 
what about me ? what about the %druchschittstypen? 
i have to talk to the man on the street who is like me , a normal consum@@ er . 
you should tell me something about my brand . 
how would you describe your bran@@ d@@ ? 
hm@@ mm , my bran@@ d@@ ? 
i do not know . 
i really like nice clo@@ the@@ s . 
wom@@ an@@ : 80 &apos;s re@@ vi@@ val meet@@ s sk@@ ate@@ r@@ pun@@ k , except on the wash@@ day . 
well , what is the brand ger@@ r@@ y@@ ? 
unique . 
i think that gen@@ re , the style i have is probably &quot; dark glam@@ or &quot; , 
i like a lot of black colors , many gra@@ ys and stuff like that . 
but usually i have an acc@@ ess@@ ory , like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and such a stuff . 
wom@@ an@@ : if then a brand would be , he would probably be a classi@@ c mer@@ ce@@ des conver@@ ti@@ ble . 
man 2@@ : the brand i am is , i would say , cas@@ ual fly . 
woman 2@@ : part@@ ly hi@@ pp@@ ie , part@@ ly yo@@ g@@ i , part@@ ly bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n girl - i do not know . 
man 3@@ : i &apos;m the cu@@ dd@@ le type . 
i sell cu@@ dd@@ ly to@@ ys throughout the country , worldwide . 
so i think that &apos;s my brand . 
this is my brand in my small , dist@@ or@@ ted industry . 
man 4@@ : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i was extra@@ di@@ ted . 
man 5@@ : brand clever al@@ co@@ hol@@ ic scri@@ be . 
is that possible ? 
law@@ ye@@ r@@ : i am a law@@ yer . 
i am tom . 
well , we can not all be the tom brand , but i often see myself at the interface of dark glam@@ or and cas@@ ual fly . 
and what is noticed was that i needed an exper@@ t . 
i needed someone who could get in my head , someone who could really help me understand what you mean by &quot; brand person@@ ality &quot; is called . 
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g . 
they helped companies like nes@@ tle , fe@@ bre@@ ze , hall@@ mark discover this brand person@@ ality . 
if they could do it for them , they could certainly help me too . 
they brought their pictures , ye@@ s@@ ? 
i have that . the first picture is a picture of my family . 
just tell me a little bit how it rela@@ tes to your thoughts and feelings about yourself . 
these are the people who shape my world@@ view . 
tell me about this world . 
m@@ d@@ : this world@@ ? i think the own world is the world in which one lives - like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so on . 
all these things come and start from one place , and for me they come and start with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a . 
what is the next thing you want to talk about . 
the next . this was the best day of my life . 
how does this rela@@ te to the thoughts and feelings about them@@ ? 
it &apos;s the way i want to be . 
i like things that are different . 
i like things that are weird . i like strange things . 
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase - what brings us@@ ? 
what is the mach@@ et@@ e@@ ? which pu@@ pa@@ l stage are you currently in@@ ? 
why is it important to rest@@ art@@ ? what does the red repres@@ ent@@ ? 
tell me a little about this part . 
a little bit more about her , that &apos;s not her . 
what other meta@@ mor@@ pho@@ ses did you go through@@ ? 
. . . that does not have to be fe@@ ar@@ ful . in what kind of roll@@ er co@@ aster are the@@ y@@ ? 
ee@@ ee@@ ee@@ ! no , thank you@@ ! 
thank you for your pati@@ ence . 
yes . , well . 
yes , i do not know what will happen . 
there were a lot of crazy things going on . 
the first thing i saw was that your brand person@@ ality had two separate but comple@@ ment@@ ary sides - the mor@@ gan spu@@ r@@ lock brand is a min@@ d@@ ful / play@@ ful brand . 
they comple@@ ment each other very well . 
and i think there is almost a contra@@ dic@@ tion with it . 
and i think some companies will focus on only one strength , rather than both . 
many companies tend to - and this is to avoid the human natural things that they are not sure about , they will avoid these elements , and that they wel@@ come them , and they actually transform them into themselves something positive , and that is a clever move . 
which other bran@@ ds are acting like thi@@ s@@ ? 
the first is a classi@@ c , apple . 
and you can also see it here , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i of min@@ i coo@@ pers and je@@ t@@ blue . 
well , there are play@@ ful bran@@ ds and min@@ d@@ ful bran@@ ds , these things that come and go , but a play@@ ful , atten@@ tive brand is a pretty strong thing . 
a thou@@ ght@@ ful , play@@ ful brand . how is your bran@@ d@@ ? 
if someone asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , how would it be@@ ? 
are you an up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ te@@ ? are you something that causes blood to flo@@ w@@ ? 
or are they more of a down@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ te@@ ? 
are they something that is a little quie@@ ter , more reser@@ ved , more conser@@ va@@ tiv@@ e@@ ? 
up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes are things that are play@@ ful , fresh as the fresh prin@@ ce , con@@ temporary , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , fan@@ cy and lo@@ vely like ero@@ l fl@@ yn@@ n , agi@@ le and agi@@ le , prof@@ an@@ e , bo@@ ss@@ y , mag@@ ical and my@@ sti@@ cal like gand@@ al@@ f . 
or are they more like a down at@@ tribu@@ te@@ ? 
are they min@@ d@@ ful and sophisticated like 00@@ 7@@ ? 
are they establi@@ shed , traditional , car@@ ing , prote@@ ctive , com@@ passionate as op@@ ra@@ h@@ ? 
are they reli@@ able , stable , famili@@ al , safe , se@@ cure , hol@@ y , thou@@ ght@@ ful and wise like the da@@ la@@ i lam@@ a or yo@@ da@@ ? 
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they did not want to be part of the project . 
above all , they wanted nothing to do with this film because they had no control , no control over the finished product . 
but 17 brand partner@@ s were found who were ready to reli@@ n@@ qui@@ sh this control , who wanted to do business with someone as atten@@ tive and play@@ ful as me , and who eventually en@@ ab@@ led us to tell stories we normally could not have told - stories a rec@@ ru@@ it would normally never support . 
they en@@ ab@@ led us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing as we tell the story in this film that mr@@ is is used no@@ wa@@ days to target the lu@@ st centers of the brain both for adverti@@ sing and making movies . 
we dro@@ ve to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where out@@ door adverti@@ sing has been ban@@ ned . 
throughout the city there has been no adverti@@ se@@ ment board for five years , no post@@ ers , no fl@@ yers , nothing . 
and we dro@@ ve to school distri@@ cts where companies are making their way to imp@@ over@@ ished schools across america . 
the unbe@@ lie@@ vable thing for me is that the projects from which i got the most feedback or where i had the greatest success are those where i inter@@ ac@@ ted directly with things . 
and that &apos;s what those bran@@ ds have done 
because they by@@ passed the middle man , they by@@ passed the agen@@ cies , and said that the agen@@ cies might not really care about their interest@@ s . 
i will negoti@@ ate directly with the artist . 
i will work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think , that challenges our world view . 
and how was that for you@@ ? what is it success@@ ful@@ ? 
well , since the film was pre@@ mier@@ ed at the sun@@ dance film festi@@ val , we can take a look at it . 
according to bur@@ rel@@ les , the pre@@ mier@@ e was in janu@@ ary , and since then - and that &apos;s not even the whole thing - there have been 9@@ 00 million vie@@ ws of this film . 
in fact , this only co@@ vers a period of two and a hal@@ f-@@ weeks . 
that &apos;s just online - no press , no tv . 
the film has not been deli@@ vered yet . 
it does not even exist online . no stre@@ aming . 
he has not come out in other countries yet . 
well , finally , the film has ga@@ ined a very big moment@@ um . 
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every adverti@@ sing agen@@ cy we spoke to re@@ comm@@ ended their custom@@ ers to keep their hands off . 
one thing i fir@@ m@@ ly believe in is that taking one &apos;s chan@@ ces invol@@ ves a risk that there are opportunities in these risks . 
i think if you stop people from doing that , you bring them closer to failure . 
i believe that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you prepar@@ e the whole company for a profit . 
i feel that as we move forward , we need to encourage people to take risks . 
we must encourage people not to be afraid of possibilities that may fri@@ ght@@ en them . 
finally , as we move forward , we should wel@@ come the fear . 
we should put the bear in the ca@@ ge . 
wel@@ come the angst . wel@@ come the risk . 
each one big spo@@ on full , so we wel@@ come the risk . 
and finally , we should wel@@ come transpar@@ ency . 
no@@ wa@@ days , more than ever , a bit of hon@@ est@@ y takes us a long way . 
and that said , with hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , all my talk &quot; wel@@ come transpar@@ ency &quot; was pres@@ ented to you by my good friends from em@@ c , who paid $ 7@@ 100 for the name rights on e@@ bay . 
big data is turned into a great opportunity for organizations around the world . 
em@@ c pres@@ ents &quot; wel@@ come transpar@@ ency &quot; 
thank you very much . 
well , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency thi@@ s@@ : what exactly happened to the $ 7@@ 10@@ 0@@ ? 
that &apos;s a great question . 
i have a check in my po@@ cket , issu@@ ed to the top organization of the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation - a check for $ 7@@ 100 to finan@@ ce my ted appe@@ ar@@ ance next year . 
my name is am@@ it . 
18 months ago , i did something else on google , and i suggest@@ ed doing something with muse@@ ums and art . my bo@@ ss , who is also today , gave me the green light . 
and it las@@ ted 18 months . 
a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries . 
but i will concent@@ rate on the performance . 
there are a lot of stories about why we did this . 
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its acc@@ essi@@ bility expla@@ ined . 
i grew up in india . 
i got a great education - i &apos;m not comp@@ la@@ ining - but i did not have access to many muse@@ ums and these art@@ works . 
when i then travel@@ ed and visi@@ ting these muse@@ ums , i started to learn a lot . 
and while i was working for google , i tried to bring that lon@@ ging - art more acc@@ essi@@ ble - with technology together . 
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started here . 
i will probably start with the demon@@ stration and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the start . 
so you just go to %googleartproject .com . 
you can look around here in all these muse@@ ums . 
there is the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , the mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh . 
i even come to one of my favorite , the met@@ rop@@ oli@@ tan museum of art in new york . 
you can sc@@ ore for two - very easy . 
click , and wu@@ mm@@ s , you are in this museum . 
it does not matter where they are - bom@@ bay , mexico , it makes no difference . 
you walk around and have fun . 
you want to ori@@ ent yourself in the muse@@ um@@ ? 
open the map and jump with one click . 
they are in there , they want to go all the way to the end . 
only further . have fun . 
brow@@ se them . 
thanks , but the best is yet to come . 
so now i am in front of one of my favorite pictures , a re@@ aper of pie@@ ter bre@@ ug@@ el in the met . 
i see this plus sign . 
if the museum has given us the picture , click on it . 
this is one of the pictures . 
this is all meta@@ data . 
those of you who are really interested in art can click here - but i &apos;ll just click away . 
this is one of the images we cap@@ tured with the so-@@ called gi@@ ga@@ pi@@ x@@ el technology . 
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els , i believe . 
and a lot of people ask me@@ : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ el@@ s@@ ? &quot; 
i will show them no@@ w@@ : 
you can zo@@ om in and out very easily . 
they see something funny here . 
i love that gu@@ y@@ ; his expression is pri@@ cele@@ ss . 
but then they really want to go deep inside . 
and so i started playing around , and found that something was going on there . 
and i thought , &quot; hang on , that sounds interesting . &quot; 
i came close , and slowly noticed that these children actually beat something . 
i resear@@ ched a bit , talked to a few ac@@ qua@@ in@@ tan@@ ces at the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called squ@@ ai@@ l , where a goo@@ se is hit with a stick on mid@@ summer &apos;s day . 
appar@@ ently it was quite popular . 
i do not know why they did it , but i learned something about it . 
to really close up , you can go to the cra@@ cks . 
just to give you an over@@ view , i zo@@ om out to see what you get . 
here we were , and this is the painting . 
but the best is still - in one second . 
let &apos;s jump quickly to the mom@@ a , again in new york . 
another favorite picture of me , star@@ ry night . 
the previous example was about finding deta@@ il@@ s@@ , 
but what if you want to see the bru@@ sh@@ stro@@ ke@@ s@@ ? 
and what if you want to see how van go@@ gh created this mas@@ ter@@ pie@@ ce@@ ? 
you zo@@ om in . you can really go inside . 
i &apos;ll zo@@ om into one of my favorite parts of this picture until i &apos;m really at the cra@@ cks . 
that is star@@ ry night , probably never seen before . 
now i will show you my favorite function . 
there are many more , but i miss the time . 
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions . 
every one of them , everyone - whether rich or poor , whether they have a great home - does not matter . 
you can get started and create your own museum online - from all these images you can create your own colle@@ ction . 
quite simply , they go in - and i created this , it &apos;s the power of zo@@ om - they can zo@@ om in and out . 
this is &apos;@@ ; the sent ones &apos;@@ ; , in the national gall@@ ery . 
you can add notes to everything , send it to your friends , and start talking about what they feel when they look at these mas@@ ter@@ pieces . 
i think , finally , for me the main thing is that all the wonderful things here are not from google . 
in my opini@@ on , they do not even come from the muse@@ ums . 
i should not say that . 
they come from the artists . 
and that was an experience in hu@@ milit@@ y for me . 
i mean , i hope that we will do justice to the art with this digital medium and represent it proper@@ ly online . 
here is the biggest question i was asked rec@@ ent@@ ly@@ : &quot; did you do that to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum visi@@ t@@ ? &quot; 
the answer is no . 
it should comple@@ ment the experience . 
it &apos;s all about this . thank you very much . 
thank you . 
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain . her brain can be divi@@ ded in half . 
this is the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side and then the right half , which is the intui@@ tive side . 
if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titude of each he@@ mi@@ sphere , we could represent its brain . 
for example , this would be someone who is completely logi@@ cal . 
this would be someone who is completely intui@@ tive . 
now , where would you position your brain on this sc@@ ale@@ ? 
some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extreme ones , but i think that for most people in the audience , their brain looks something like this - with a high ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ te that is in both he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es at the same time . 
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exc@@ lu@@ sive or the like . 
they can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive . 
and so i see myself as one of the people , along with most other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ cis@@ ts who need a good deal of logi@@ c to put the complex ideas together . 
but at the same time we need a good amount of intuition to actually do the experiments . 
how do we develop this intui@@ tion@@ ? well , we love to play with things . 
so we go out and play with it and then look how it re@@ acts . and then we begin to develop our intuition . 
basically , they do the same thing . 
so one of the intui@@ tions that you have developed over the years is probably that a thing can only be in one place at the same time . 
i mean , it may sound weird to think that a thing is in two different places at the same time , but you were not born with that idea , you developed it . 
i remember seeing a kid playing on a floor level . 
he was still a to@@ dd@@ ler and not very good at it and he was constantly fall@@ ing . 
but i bet that playing with the floor thre@@ sho@@ ld taught him a very valuable lesson , nam@@ ely that big things do not just let you pass and that they stay in one place . 
and that is a great concep@@ tual model of the world , as long as you are not a partic@@ le physi@@ cis@@ t . 
it would be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ cis@@ t , because they do not play with sle@@ ep@@ ers , but with those little weird particles . 
and when they play with their particles , they spot all sorts of strange things - like flying right through walls , or at the same time being in two different places . 
and so they all wrote down these obser@@ va@@ tions , calling them the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics . 
that was the state of physics a few years ag@@ o@@ ; you needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe the tiny , tiny particles . 
but you did not need them to describe the big everyday objects around us . 
that did not like my intuition and that maybe only because i do not play with so many parts . 
well , sometimes i play with them , but not very often . 
and i have never seen her 
i mean , no one has ever seen a partic@@ le . 
but my logi@@ cal side did not like it either . 
because if all things consi@@ st of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , should not everything just follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ic@@ s@@ ? 
i see no reason why that should not be so . 
so i would feel much better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics . 
so , a few years ago , i set about doing just that . 
i created one . 
this is the first object you can see that was in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position . 
so what we are looking at here is a tiny computer chip . 
and you can see this green do@@ t in the middle there . 
this is the piece of metal that i will talk about in a moment . 
this is a picture of the object . 
here i en@@ large it a bit . we are looking right here in the center . 
and here is a really huge clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal . 
so what we &apos;re looking at is a small piece of metal sha@@ ped like a spr@@ ing@@ board and over@@ han@@ ging the edge . 
so i made this thing in a similar way to making a computer chip . 
i went into a clean room with new silicon wa@@ fer@@ s , and ra@@ cked for 100 hours on all the big appli@@ ance@@ s . 
for the last bit i had to build my own machine - to get this hole sha@@ ped like a swi@@ mming pool and the thing . 
this thing has the ability to be in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position but it needs a little help to do it . 
look , let me give you an analog@@ y . 
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a full ele@@ vat@@ or@@ ? 
i mean , when i &apos;m alone in the ele@@ vat@@ or , i do all sorts of strange things but then other people get in and i stop doing all those things because i do not want to bot@@ her them or , frank@@ ly , bot@@ her them . 
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that im@@ mov@@ able objects feel the same way . 
the ri@@ ders for im@@ mov@@ able objects are not just humans , but also the light that shi@@ nes on them and the wind that blo@@ ws past them and the heat of space . 
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal beha@@ ves quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we had to throw all the pas@@ sen@@ gers out . 
and we did that . 
we swi@@ t@@ ched off the light , put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and suc@@ ked all the air out and cool@@ ed it almost to the now , all alone in the ele@@ vat@@ or , the piece of metal was free to beha@@ ve as it would . 
so we measu@@ red his movement . 
we realized that it is really moving stran@@ gely . 
instead of just lying there , it vi@@ bra@@ ted . the way it vi@@ bra@@ ted was like this , like an expan@@ ding bel@@ lo@@ ws pul@@ ling together . 
by giving it a little push , we could cause it to vi@@ bra@@ te and not vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time - something only allowed in quant@@ um mechan@@ ics . 
what i am about to tell you is something truly fantastic . 
what does it mean for an object to vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time and not to vi@@ bra@@ te@@ ? 
let us think about the atoms . 
so the first cas@@ e@@ : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms that make up the piece of metal lie still and at the same time the same atoms move up and down . 
only at pre@@ cise times do they agree . 
the rest of the time they are del@@ oc@@ ali@@ sed . 
that is , each at@@ om is at the same time in two different places , which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places . 
i think that &apos;s really cool . 
for real . 
it was worth it to inclu@@ de me in the clean room for all these years . because , check that , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and them . 
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time , this piece of metal can be in two different places , then why not them to@@ o@@ ? 
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logi@@ cal side says . 
so , imagine that you are in several places at the same time , how would that feel@@ ? 
how would you be aware that your body is del@@ oc@@ alized in spac@@ e@@ ? 
there is another aspe@@ ct of the story . 
when we warm it up , turned on the light and looked in the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in one piece . 
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the ele@@ vat@@ or are in reality only quant@@ um objects that have come together in a small room . 
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is connected to everything . 
well , that &apos;s not quite ri@@ ght@@ ; 
there is more behind it , it goes even deeper . 
it &apos;s like these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and that is the profound and strange of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics . 
many thanks . 
in 2007 , i decided that we should re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we think about economic development . 
it should be our goal that , when families think about where they want to live and work , they have the opportunity to choose between at least one hand@@ ful of different cities , all of which are in competition for new resi@@ dents . 
at the moment we are far away from this goal . 
there are billions of people in developing countries who do not even have a single city to wel@@ come . 
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more valuable than they cost to build . 
so we could easily equi@@ p the world with do@@ zens , maybe even hundreds of new cities . 
this may sound pre@@ post@@ ero@@ us for you , as long as you &apos;ve never thought about new cities . 
just swa@@ p the construction of fla@@ ts against the ones of cities . 
imagine , half the people who want to live in fla@@ ts already do th@@ at@@ ; the other half but not yet . 
you could try to increase the capacity of already exist@@ ing fla@@ ts . 
but do you know what you would get involved with , in these ap@@ art@@ ments and their surro@@ und@@ ings laws pre@@ va@@ il to avoid comp@@ la@@ in@@ ts and dist@@ ra@@ ct from expan@@ sion . 
it turns out to be very difficult to comp@@ ly with all these exten@@ sions . 
but you could go to a completely new place , build a completely new block of fla@@ ts , provi@@ ded the laws there would support such construction and not hin@@ der him . 
so i suggest@@ ed that governments create new space that would provide enough space for a city and gave them a nam@@ e@@ : char@@ ter cities . 
later i found out that , around the same time , ja@@ vier and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of a re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as . 
they knew that every year about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans left their country to e@@ migr@@ ate to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do the same in hon@@ dur@@ as can . 
at this point , ja@@ vier said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what happens if we take an un@@ popul@@ ated area of ​​our country - which if we just give it to a message - part of the american em@@ bas@@ sy , ​​part of the can@@ adi@@ an em@@ bas@@ sy - and then people working under can@@ adi@@ an or united states rules , can you work there , and can you do anything on the surface of these mess@@ ages that you would normally need to go to canada or americ@@ a@@ ? &quot; 
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as suff@@ ered from a violent const@@ it@@ u@@ tional crisis . 
at the next sche@@ dul@@ ed elec@@ tions , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a tur@@ na@@ round whose program promis@@ ed both rene@@ wa@@ l and conc@@ ili@@ ation . 
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his chi@@ e@@ f of staf@@ f . 
in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing for a lec@@ ture at ted@@ global . 
by impro@@ ving , trying out and exam@@ ining consum@@ ers , i have tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to the essential elements . 
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determin@@ e that it is not allowed to dist@@ ur@@ b already exist@@ ing a@@ partment ow@@ ners . 
we pay great attention to new technologies , but progress requires technology and legi@@ sla@@ tion . and it &apos;s usually laws that hold us back . 
in au@@ tu@@ m@@ n 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the ted@@ talk . 
in turn , ja@@ vier showed him . 
the two called to me . 
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present that to the president of our coun@@ tr@@ y@@ ! &quot; 
so in dec@@ ember we met in the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om of a mi@@ ami hotel . 
i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost . 
and i have used this graphic to show how valuable roh@@ land is in a place like new york . remember , in some cases , one square is worth thousands of dollars per square meter . 
but it was a fairly abstra@@ ct discussion , at one point , when there was a break , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the ted@@ talk . &quot; 
the ted@@ talk th@@ us pres@@ ented in a very simple form that a char@@ ter city is a place whose beginning is uni@@ n@@ habit@@ ed land , a foun@@ ding treat@@ y that sets the laws that gover@@ n it and off@@ ers people the opportunity to choose , either under these rules live or not . 
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , who said that we must realize this project , that it is important and that this is the way to move our country forward . 
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and give another lec@@ ture on the fourth and fif@@ th of janu@@ ary . 
so i gave another lec@@ ture filled with facts that con@@ tain@@ ed a graphic like this that tries to make it clear that if you want to add value to a city , it has to be a very big city . 
this is a picture of the city den@@ ver , and the ske@@ tch represents the new air@@ port built in den@@ ver . 
this air@@ port alone has an area of ​​100 square kilometers . 
so i tried to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ans , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a terri@@ tory of at least 10@@ 00 square kilometers . 
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow . 
poli@@ tely everyone appl@@ au@@ ded . 
the faces of the spec@@ tat@@ ors were very serious and atten@@ tive . 
the head of the con@@ gress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your pres@@ entation , but maybe we could look at the ted@@ talk . 
i have it here on my laptop . &quot; 
so i sat down and they played the ted@@ talk . 
and i came to the core stat@@ ement that a new city off@@ ers people new possibilities . 
it would be possible to live in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north . 
and a new city also inclu@@ des new opportunities for leaders . 
the leaders of the hon@@ dur@@ an government rely on help from partner countries to benefit from their partner countries , which would help them to set up laws for this char@@ ter and to ens@@ ure that everyone can trust that the char@@ ter will really be en@@ forced , 
and the recogni@@ tion of president lo@@ bo , was that the certain@@ ty of the en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment that i thought of as a way to get the foreign invest@@ ors coming here and to build this city could be syn@@ ony@@ mous to all the parti@@ es in hon@@ dur@@ as who have been afraid for many years and years dis@@ trust suff@@ er . 
we dro@@ ve into an area . 
this picture is from this place . 
it ef@@ fort@@ less@@ ly co@@ vers a thousand square kilometers . 
and shor@@ tly there@@ after , on janu@@ ary 19 , they vot@@ ed in fa@@ vor of a const@@ it@@ u@@ tional change con@@ gress to have a const@@ it@@ u@@ tional regi@@ me per@@ miss@@ ib@@ le for specific development areas . 
in a country that has just come through a violent crisis , 12@@ 4 was vot@@ ed one vote in the con@@ gress for this const@@ it@@ u@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment . 
all parti@@ es , all fac@@ tions of society , suppor@@ ted this . 
however , to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution , it must be appro@@ ved twice by the con@@ gress . 
on the 17@@ th of febru@@ ary it was appro@@ ved for the second time with 1@@ 14 to a vote . 
immediately after this elec@@ tion , between the 21@@ st and the 24@@ th of febru@@ ary , a del@@ eg@@ ation of about 30 hun@@ dur@@ ans travel@@ ed to the two places of the world that were most interested in enter@@ ing the business of urban design . 
one place is south korea . 
this is a picture of a big new city center built in south korea - bigger than boston &apos;s city center . 
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after taking four years to get the per@@ mit@@ s . 
the other place , which was very interested in urban planning , is sing@@ apo@@ re . 
two cities have already been built in china and the third is in prepar@@ ation . 
so when you think about it practic@@ ally , that &apos;s where we stand today . 
you already have a building plo@@ t@@ ; and you are already consi@@ der@@ ing this area for the second city . 
it is already working on a legal system that allows mana@@ gers to participa@@ te , and it is also working on an ex@@ ternal legal system . 
a country has already off@@ ered to have its sup@@ re@@ me cour@@ t available , as a cour@@ t for the final ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment of the local jud@@ ic@@ i@@ ary . 
also city designers and buil@@ ders are very interested . 
they even bring in finan@@ cing . 
one thing , as you already know , has already been cla@@ ri@@ fied , there are many ten@@ ants . 
there are many companies that would like to sett@@ le in america , especially in a place with a free trade area , and there are many people who would like to live there . 
there are 700 million people around the world who say they would like to live perman@@ ently in a different place . 
one million people leave lat@@ in america each year and e@@ migr@@ ate to the united states . 
many of them are fa@@ thers who are forced to leave their families behind to see@@ k work - sometimes they are single mothers who have to ear@@ n enough money to be able to afford food and clo@@ the@@ s . 
unfortunately , sometimes there are even children who try to find their parents again , who in some cases have not seen them for a decade . 
so what &apos;s the idea of ​​thinking about building a brand new city in hon@@ dur@@ as@@ ? 
or even do@@ zens of these cities to build , or hundreds distribu@@ ted around the world@@ ? 
so what &apos;s the idea for insi@@ sting that every family has a choice between several cities in competition for new resi@@ dent@@ s@@ ? 
that &apos;s an idea worth spre@@ ading . 
my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as have asked me to say thank you ted . 
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical da@@ y@@ ? 
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical wee@@ k@@ ? 
i &apos;ve recently done a survey of over 2,000 americans and the average number of decisions that a typical americans make in one day is 70 . 
in addition , a study was recently made with ce@@ os in which they watched the ce@@ os for a week . 
and these scientists have just docum@@ ented the different top@@ ics that have occu@@ pie@@ d this ce@@ o . and how much time they spent making decisions related to the issues . 
and they have found that an average ce@@ o dea@@ ls with 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks during the week . 
of course , each of these top@@ ics consi@@ sted of many , many smaller decisions . 
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less . 
it took only an hour or more of their time for about 12 percent of their decisions . 
think about your own decisions . 
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minute categ@@ ory compared to the one hour categ@@ or@@ y@@ ? 
how good do you think they are in making the decisi@@ on@@ s@@ ? 
today i want to talk about one of the biggest decision problems of our modern age , the decision over@@ load problem . 
i would like to talk about the problem and some possible solutions . 
well , if i talk about this problem , i will ask you some questions and i would like to know your answers . 
if i ask you a question , since i am blind , they only li@@ ft your hand if you want to burn some cal@@ ories . 
otherwise , if i ask you a question and your answer is yes , then my first question for today is@@ : are you ready to hear about the con@@ ges@@ tion proble@@ m@@ ? 
many thanks . 
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very very exc@@ lu@@ sive gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e@@ ; at least then he was really exc@@ lu@@ sive . 
it was a shop , the dra@@ eg@@ er &apos;@@ ; his name was . 
this shop , it was almost like a fun park . 
they had 250 different types of mus@@ tar@@ d and vi@@ nega@@ r and over 500 different types of fru@@ it and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different types of water - and that was at a time when we were actually drin@@ king ta@@ p water . 
i loved going to this busin@@ ess@@ ; but at one point i wonder@@ ed , well , how come you never buy any@@ thin@@ g@@ ? 
here is the oli@@ ve oil gang . 
they had over 75 different vari@@ et@@ ies of oli@@ ve oil , including those that were tra@@ pped in bo@@ xes that came from %thousand-year-old oli@@ ve trees . 
so one day i decided to visit the store mana@@ ger , and i asked the mana@@ ger , &quot; does this model really work to provide people with all these opti@@ on@@ s@@ ? &quot; 
and he poin@@ ted to the bus@@ lo@@ ads of tour@@ ists who came every day and usually had their c@@ ameras with them . 
we decided to do an experiment and we cho@@ se ja@@ m for our experiment . 
here is her ja@@ m shop . 
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different types of ja@@ m . 
we set up a small tas@@ ting corner right at the ent@@ ran@@ ce to the store . 
there were six different tas@@ tes of ja@@ m or 24 different tas@@ tes of ja@@ m , and we looked at two thin@@ gs@@ : fir@@ stly , in which case would more people stop and try jam@@ ? 
there were more people standing still when there were 24 , about 60 percent than when there were six , about 40 percent . 
and then we looked at in which case people rather bought a ja@@ r of ja@@ m . 
now we saw the rever@@ se effect . 
of the people who stopped when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a ja@@ r of ja@@ m . 
of the people who stopped when they were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a ja@@ r of ja@@ m . 
well , if you figure it out , people would rather buy a ja@@ r six times if they had six to choose from than if they had 24 to choose from . 
well , deci@@ ding not to buy ja@@ r ja@@ m is probably good for us - at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ ist - but it turns out that the con@@ ges@@ tion problem affec@@ ts us even in very consequ@@ enti@@ al decisions . 
we decide not to decide , even if it is against our own best interest@@ s . 
so on the top@@ ic of the da@@ y@@ : financial sav@@ ings . 
i will now describe to you a study that i conduc@@ ted with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , em@@ ir ke@@ m@@ - ji@@ ca , we@@ i jan@@ g , in which we considered the decisions on sav@@ ings plans for the pen@@ sion of nearly one million americans from appro@@ xi@@ mat@@ ely 6@@ 50 plans throughout the united states . 
and what we were looking at was whether the number of fund off@@ er@@ ings that were possible in a pen@@ sion plan , the plan , the lik@@ eli@@ hood of whether more is saved for tomorrow . 
and we found out that there was indeed a connection . 
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that off@@ ered to the people anything between two to 5@@ 9 different fund@@ s . 
and what we found out was that the more fund@@ s were off@@ ered that , in fact , the atten@@ dance rate was lower . 
looking at the extreme now , the plans off@@ ered by the two fund@@ s had a participa@@ tion rate in the se@@ venti@@ es - still not as high as we would like . 
in the plans , which off@@ ered nearly 60 fund@@ s , the participa@@ tion rate now fell to about the six@@ tie@@ th percent . 
now it turns out that even if they decide to participa@@ te , if more choices are available , even then , it has negative consequences . 
for example , people who choose to participa@@ te more in the sense that the more opportunities they have , the more they avoid choo@@ sing stock@@ s and fund@@ s . 
the more opportunities they had , the more they put their money into pur@@ e money market accoun@@ ts . 
none of these extreme decisions are among the decisions that someone would re@@ comm@@ end to people if their future financial well-@@ being is important to us . 
well , over the past decade , we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences for people , which means off@@ ering more and more choices . 
they post@@ pon@@ e the decision - post@@ pon@@ e it , even if it is against their own best interest@@ s . 
they tend to make worse decisions - worse financial and poor@@ er medical decisions . 
they tend to choose things that make them less satis@@ fied , even if they make things better . 
the main reason for this is that we might enjoy looking at these huge shel@@ ves full of may@@ on@@ nai@@ se , mus@@ tar@@ d , vi@@ nega@@ r and ja@@ m , but in fact we can not draw the compar@@ iso@@ ns and dem@@ arc@@ ations and then actually choose something from the fantastic off@@ er@@ ings . 
so what i would like to suggest to you today are four simple techniques - techniques that we have tes@@ ted in different ways and in different research lo@@ cations - that you can easily apply to your business . 
first , restri@@ ct . 
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been tru@@ er than today that less is more . 
people are always worried when i say , &quot; lim@@ it . &quot; 
they always worry about losing shel@@ f space . 
but in truth , we see it more and more and more that when they are ready to confi@@ ne themselves , and the un@@ important similar possibilities are rele@@ ased , well , then there is an increase in sal@@ es , the costs are lo@@ wer@@ ed , and there is an impro@@ vement in decisi@@ on-@@ making . 
when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble redu@@ ced the various head and shoul@@ ders types from 26 to 15 , they saw their sal@@ es increase by 10 percent . 
when the gold@@ en ca@@ t corpo@@ ration got rid of its 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling fel@@ ine stra@@ ins , they saw profi@@ ts increase 8@@ 7 percent , a result of both the increase in sal@@ es and the redu@@ ction in costs . 
you know , the average super@@ market today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products . 
a typical wal@@ mar@@ t off@@ ers you 100,000 products today . 
but the nin@@ th largest super@@ market , now the nin@@ th largest super@@ market in the world , is al@@ di , and they offer you only 1,@@ 400 products - a kind of can@@ ned tom@@ at@@ o sau@@ ce . 
now in the saving world , i believe one of the best examples recently launched , how best to manage the choices was something david da@@ vie@@ s stron@@ gl@@ y helped shape , it is a program that will help harvard is off@@ ered . 
every single harvard employe@@ e now auto@@ matically takes part in a lifetime fund . 
those who really want to make a sele@@ ction will be off@@ ered 20 fund@@ s , not 300 or more . 
you know , as people often say , &quot; i do not know how to lim@@ it it . 
they are all important possibilities . &quot; 
and the first thing i am the hir@@ ed question , &quot; tell me how the possibilities diff@@ er from each other . 
and if your employees can not tell you apart , your custom@@ ers can not . &quot; 
well , before we started this after@@ noon , i had a talk with gar@@ y . 
and gar@@ y said he was ready to offer all people in this audience an all@@ -@@ inclu@@ sive paid vac@@ ation to the most beautiful street in the world . 
here is a descri@@ ption of the street . 
and i would like to read them to you . 
and now i give them a few seconds to read them and then i ask them to cla@@ p when they are ready gar@@ y &apos;@@ ; s offer . 
okay . everyone who is ready , gar@@ y &apos;@@ ; s offer . 
are they all@@ ? 
well , let me show you a little more about it . 
they knew it was a trick , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
well , who is ready for this trip . 
i think i may have heard more hands . 
good . 
the fact is , obje@@ c@@ tively , they had more information the first time than the second time , but i would dar@@ e to guess that the second time they felt it was more real . 
because the pictures made it feel more real for them . 
what brings me to the second techni@@ que , which helps you to deal with the problem of decision over@@ lo@@ ading , it is the conc@@ reti@@ zation . 
the point is that in order to understand the difference between possibilities , people must understand which consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that these consequences must be felt vi@@ vi@@ dly and conc@@ re@@ tely . 
why , on average , do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on an e@@ c card or credit card than cas@@ h@@ ? 
because it does not feel like real money . 
and it turns out that if you make it feel conc@@ re@@ te , it &apos;s a great tool to make people save more . 
so , in a study i made with sh@@ lo@@ mo ben@@ art@@ z@@ i and ale@@ ss@@ and@@ r@@ o previ@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with the people at ing - employees who all worked for ing - and these people were all in a gather@@ ing in the you have regi@@ stere@@ d your participa@@ tion for your pen@@ sion plan . 
and during this gather@@ ing , we left this gather@@ ing exactly as it always was , only we add@@ ed a little something . 
the little thing we add@@ ed was that we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they saved money . 
by doing this simple thing , there was a 20@@ % increase in atten@@ dance and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save , or a four percent increase in the amount they were willing to pay for the sav@@ ings account , 
the third techni@@ que@@ : categ@@ ori@@ zation . 
we can deal better with more categ@@ ories than with more choices . 
here &apos;s , for example , a study we did in a magazine re@@ view . 
it turns out that in the weg@@ man@@ s super@@ markets up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast area , the number vari@@ es from 3@@ 3@@ 1 different types of maga@@ zin@@ es to up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 maga@@ zin@@ es . 
but do you know what@@ ? 
if i show them 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and divi@@ de them into 10 categ@@ ories or i show you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es and divi@@ de them into 20 categ@@ ories , then i believe i gave them more choice and a better sele@@ ction experience than i gave them the 400 if i gave them the 600 
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart . 
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry dis@@ plays . 
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other is called &quot; s@@ wing &quot; , 
if you think that the left indi@@ cat@@ or is s@@ wing and the indi@@ cat@@ or on the right is ja@@ zz , then cla@@ p your hands . 
okay , there are a few . 
if you think the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing then please cla@@ p . 
okay , a few more . 
well , it turns out they &apos;re right . 
the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what@@ ? 
this is a highly use@@ less categ@@ ori@@ zation sche@@ me . 
the categ@@ ories must tell the sele@@ ctor something not to which the sele@@ ction provi@@ des . 
and you often see this problem when you look at the long li@@ sts of all these fund@@ s . 
who do you want to infor@@ m@@ ? 
my fourth techni@@ que@@ : requi@@ reme@@ nt for complexity . 
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think , we just have to simpli@@ fy it . 
we have to increase the complexity slowly . 
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean . 
let us take a very , very complicated decisi@@ on@@ : buying a car . 
here is a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er who off@@ ers you the possibility to con@@ figure your car completely yourself . 
you have to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to completely design your car . 
now these choices diff@@ er in the number of choices they make per decision . 
car color , ex@@ teri@@ or color of the car - i have 5@@ 6 opti@@ ons . 
motor@@ s , ge@@ arb@@ ox@@ es - four opti@@ ons . 
what i am doing now is changing the order in which the decisions appear . 
the half of the custom@@ ers goes from the many possibilities , 5@@ 6 car colors to the low possibilities , four trans@@ mis@@ sions . 
the other half of the custom@@ ers goes from the small opti@@ ons , four ge@@ arb@@ ox@@ es , to the 5@@ 6 car colors , many possibilities . 
what do i look at@@ ? 
how interested are you . 
if you constantly use the standard sele@@ ction in the decision , that means that they are over@@ whe@@ l@@ med , that is , i lose them . 
what you find out is that people who go from many to low sele@@ ction opti@@ ons choose the standard sele@@ ction over and over again . 
we lose it . 
go from the few choices to the many , then stick to it . 
it &apos;s the same information . it is the same number of possibilities . 
the only thing that i have done is change the order in which this information is pres@@ ented . 
when i start with the simple one , i learn how to pick . 
even though pic@@ king the ge@@ ar does not tell me about my inter@@ ior design pre@@ fer@@ ences , it still prepar@@ es me to pick . 
it also exc@@ ites me about the great product that i put together , so i &apos;m ready to be motiv@@ ated to be there with interest . 
let me sum@@ mar@@ ize . 
i told you about four techniques that mit@@ ig@@ ate the problem of decision over@@ lo@@ ading - lim@@ it - they get rid of red@@ und@@ ant alterna@@ tiv@@ es@@ ; conc@@ reti@@ ze - make it real@@ ; categ@@ ori@@ ze - we can deal better with more categ@@ ories , less opti@@ on@@ s@@ ; to prepar@@ e for complexity . 
any of the techniques i am descri@@ bing to you today is designed to help you manage the possibilities - good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you serve . 
because i believe that the key to the best possible choice is that one is pic@@ ky in the sele@@ ction . 
and the more we are pic@@ ky at pic@@ king , the better we will be able to practice the art of decision making . 
many thanks . 
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in allo@@ c@@ ca , trends mana@@ ger on youtube . profession@@ ally i look at youtube videos . 
that &apos;s true . 
today we want to talk about how videos become vir@@ al , and then why that &apos;s important at all . 
we all want to be stars - cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans - when i was young this seemed so incredibly difficult . 
but web@@ videos have made it possible for us all or all of our creative activi@@ ties to become incredibly famous in part of the culture of our world . 
every one of you could be famous on the internet until next satur@@ day . 
but youtube up@@ lo@@ ads more than 4@@ 8 hours of video per minute . 
of these , only a tiny percentage ever becomes vir@@ al and is vie@@ wed thousands of times , becoming a cultural moment . 
so how does it work@@ ? 
three thin@@ gs@@ : tas@@ te@@ maker , participa@@ tion communities and the un@@ expected . 
well , let &apos;s go . 
oh my god . oh my god . 
oh my god ! 
wo@@ ah@@ ! 
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ ! 
last year , bear vas@@ que@@ z sent this video he had film@@ ed in front of his home in yo@@ se@@ mit@@ e national park . 
in 2010 , it had been vie@@ wed 23 million times . 
this graphic shows what it looked like when the video first became popular last summer . 
actually , bear did not want to make a vir@@ al video . 
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bow@@ , 
because that &apos;s what you do when you call yo@@ se@@ mit@@ e mountain bear . 
he had up@@ lo@@ aded a lot of nature videos . 
and this video was actually sent in janu@@ ary . 
what happened here ? 
there came ji@@ mm@@ y ki@@ mm@@ el . 
ji@@ mm@@ y ki@@ mm@@ el sent the tw@@ ee@@ t that made the video so popular last time . 
tas@@ te@@ makers like ji@@ mm@@ y ki@@ mm@@ el introduce us to new and interesting things and show them to a large audience . 
it &apos;@@ ; s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got@@ ta get down on fri@@ day . everybody &apos;@@ ; looking forward to the wee@@ ken@@ d , wee@@ ken@@ d . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . ge@@ tt@@ in &apos;@@ ; down on fri@@ day . you did not think we would do this enter@@ tainment without talking about this video , i hope . 
re@@ bec@@ ca black@@ s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year . 
it has been vie@@ wed almost 200 million times this year . 
that &apos;s what the graphi@@ cs looked like . 
just like &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; it seems to have come from nothing . 
what happened that da@@ y@@ ? 
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s right . 
if you &apos;@@ ; s want to know@@ : these other ti@@ ps are also fri@@ day . 
but what about this day , this particular fri@@ da@@ y@@ ? 
well , to@@ sh .@@ 0 it for@@ ked out , many blogs started writing about it . 
michael j . nel@@ son from the myster@@ y science theater was the first to make a jo@@ ke on twitter . 
importantly , an individual or group of tas@@ te@@ makers took a stand , shared with a large audience , and th@@ us acceler@@ ated the process . 
then this community formed of people who shared this great insi@@ der jo@@ ke and started talking and playing around with it . 
now there are 10,000 par@@ od@@ ies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; at youtube . 
in the first seven days there was a par@@ od@@ y for every single wee@@ k@@ day . 
unlike the one-@@ si@@ ded enter@@ tainment of the 20th century , the participa@@ tion of the community is our way of becoming part of this phenomenon - either by spre@@ ading it or making something new out of it . 
&quot; n@@ y@@ an ca@@ t &quot; is anima@@ tion and music in end@@ less loo@@ p . 
that &apos;s it , very simple . 
this year it was vie@@ wed almost 50 million times . 
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-@@ hour version of it , which was vie@@ wed four million times . 
even cat@@ s are watching this video . 
cat@@ s look at cat@@ s watching this video . 
importantly , the creativity that pre@@ vail@@ s in the internet culture of tech@@ ies and ge@@ ek@@ s . 
there were re@@ mix@@ es . 
someone made an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of it . 
and then it became international . 
an entire re@@ mix community shot up from the ground , turning it from a stupid jo@@ ke into something we can all take part in . 
today we do not just enjoy something , we join in . 
who could have fore@@ seen all thi@@ s@@ ? 
who would have &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an ca@@ t &quot; can predi@@ ct@@ ? 
which scri@@ p@@ ts could you have written in which something is in there@@ ? 
in a world in which every minute 2 days video material is up@@ lo@@ aded , only really unique and un@@ expected can stand out as the mentioned videos . 
i ad@@ mit , i was not particularly interested when a friend told me to watch this great video , about a guy prote@@ sting in new york against bi@@ cycle bil@@ ls . 
i got a stam@@ mer because i did not ride on the bi@@ ke path , but there are often dis@@ abilities that do not let you drive dec@@ ently on the bi@@ ke path . 
since this was completely surprising and hum@@ or@@ ous , cas@@ ey nie@@ sta@@ t &apos;s funny idea and his argument was vie@@ wed 5 million times . 
this approach appli@@ es to everything new that we do crea@@ tively . 
and all that leads us to the one big question . . . 
what does that mean ? 
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h . 
what does that mean ? 
tas@@ te@@ maker , creative participa@@ nt communities , totally un@@ expected , are the fe@@ atures of a new kind of media and culture to which everyone has access and in which the audience determin@@ es popul@@ ari@@ ty . 
as i said , one of the biggest stars - justi@@ n bie@@ ber - made his deb@@ ut on youtube . 
nobody has to give your ideas green light . 
and today we all feel like the ow@@ ners of our pop culture . 
and these are not the fe@@ atures of the old media and they are hard@@ ly appli@@ cab@@ le to the media of today , but they will determin@@ e the enter@@ tainment of the future . 
many thanks . 
how can i talk about the %interconnectedness of women over three generations in ten minutes , and how the amazing strength of this bon@@ da@@ ge mani@@ fest@@ ed itself in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl when she was with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother over five years ago hu@@ dd@@ led in a small boat in the chinese sea for long ni@@ ghts . a bon@@ d that became fir@@ m@@ ly roo@@ ted in the life of this little girl and never disappe@@ ared - this little girl who now lives in san francisco and speak@@ s to them to@@ da@@ y@@ ? 
the story is not over yet . 
she is a puzz@@ le that is still put together . 
i would like to tell you about some of the puzz@@ le pieces . 
imagine the first pie@@ ce@@ : a man who bur@@ ns his life &apos;s work . 
he is a poe@@ t , a writer , a man whose whole life was held together by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home@@ land . 
as the commun@@ ists mar@@ ched into sa@@ ig@@ on , remember how he had to ad@@ mit that his life had been a waste . 
the words , as long as his friends mo@@ cked his now . 
he with@@ dre@@ w into the quie@@ t . 
he died , broken by the story . 
he is my grand@@ father . 
i never met him in person . 
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies . 
my grandmother never let me forget his life . 
i had to make sure that it was not in va@@ in , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to cru@@ sh us , but we survi@@ ved it . 
the next puzz@@ le piece shows how a boat in the early morning red quie@@ tly run@@ s out to sea . 
my mother ma@@ i was 18 when her father died - already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , already with two little girls . 
for her , life had set her a tas@@ k@@ : the flight of her family and a new life in australia . 
it was completely out of the question that she could fail . 
after a four@@ -year-old and cin@@ e@@ matic sa@@ g@@ a , a boat gli@@ ded sil@@ ently onto the la@@ ke , cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ged as a fishing boat . 
all adults were aware of the risks . 
the biggest fear was pir@@ acy , ra@@ pe and death . 
like most adults on the boat , my mother car@@ ried a small po@@ ison bottle with her . 
when i was cap@@ tured , my sister and i , and then she and my grandmother would have dru@@ n@@ k . 
my first memor@@ ies are of this boat - the ste@@ ad@@ y ch@@ ug@@ ging of the engine , the cla@@ pping of each wave on the bo@@ w , the wide and empty hori@@ zon . 
i do not remember the pir@@ ates who came many times , but were fo@@ ol@@ ed by the dea@@ th-@@ des@@ pair of the men on our boat , or by the failure of the engine , which did not want to start six hours . 
but i remember the lights of the oil platform off the mal@@ a@@ y@@ si@@ an coast , and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple that one of the men on the platform gave . 
no apple has ever tas@@ ted like this again . 
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in mel@@ bo@@ ur@@ ne . 
and the next piece of the puzz@@ le is about four women in three generations who are building a new life together . 
we sett@@ led in foot@@ sc@@ ray , a work@@ ing-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ b whose population consi@@ sts of im@@ migr@@ ant strat@@ a . 
unlike the ol@@ d-@@ establi@@ shed mid@@ -@@ range sub@@ ur@@ bs whose existence was completely un@@ known to me , there was no pre@@ ten@@ sion in foot@@ sc@@ ray . 
the sm@@ ells from the shop do@@ ors came from the rest of the world . 
and the sc@@ ra@@ ps of broken english were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in comm@@ on@@ : they started a@@ fresh . 
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a production line in a car factory , six days , two shif@@ ts . 
somehow she managed to find the time to ac@@ qui@@ re english and %it-qualifications . 
we were poor . 
every dollar was allo@@ cated and put into further education for english and math , no matter what we had to do without . mostly new things were always secon@@ d-@@ hand . 
two pa@@ irs of stock@@ ings for school , each to cover the holes in the other . 
a school uni@@ form to the ank@@ les , because she had to reach six years . 
and there were the rare but pain@@ ful cho@@ irs of &quot; schl@@ it@@ z@@ auge &quot; and here and there mur@@ al@@ s@@ : &quot; asi@@ ans , go home . &quot; 
home where to go@@ ? 
something stif@@ fen@@ ed in me . 
there was a meeting for re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation and a quie@@ t voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll get you out of the way . &quot; 
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed . 
my mother was ex@@ haus@@ ted every night , but we told each other about our day and listen@@ ed to the movements of our grandmother in the house . 
my mother suff@@ ered from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es from the boat . 
and it was my job to stay a@@ wake every night until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so i could wake her up . 
she opened a computer business , then did a bak@@ er &apos;s education and started another business . 
and the women came with their stories about men who did not stand the change , ang@@ ry and in@@ flexi@@ ble , and car@@ ing children tra@@ pped between two world@@ s . 
lo@@ ans and spon@@ sor@@ s were sou@@ ght . 
centers were set up . 
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l world@@ s . 
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student who made ine@@ x@@ or@@ able dem@@ ands on himself . 
in the other , i was involved in inse@@ cure lives carrying tra@@ gic sc@@ ars of violence , drug ab@@ use and isol@@ ation . 
but so many got help over the years . 
and because of this help , in my final year of law school , i was sele@@ cted as the young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year . 
and i was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from piece to piece and the ed@@ ges did not match . 
tan@@ le , an anony@@ mous resi@@ dent of foot@@ sc@@ ray , was now a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activi@@ st invited to lec@@ tures she had never heard of and to d@@ well@@ ings she could never have imag@@ ined . 
i was not familiar with the lab@@ el . 
i did not know how to use the cu@@ t@@ ler@@ y . 
i did not know how to talk about wine . 
i did not know how to talk about anything . 
i wanted to go back into the rou@@ tin@@ e and comfort of the life of an un@@ known sub@@ ur@@ b - a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ ght@@ ers who comple@@ ted each of their days as they had for tw@@ ent@@ y years , telling each other the stories of their day and fall@@ ing a@@ sleep , we three still in the same bed . 
i told my mother i would not be able to do that . 
she remin@@ ded me that i was the same age as she was when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the boat . 
no was never a possibility . 
&quot; just do it &quot; , she said . &quot; and do not be what you are not . &quot; 
so i talked about you@@ th un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment and education , and the ne@@ gl@@ ec@@ t of the mar@@ gi@@ n@@ alized and dise@@ n@@ fran@@ chi@@ sed . 
and the more open@@ ly i spoke , the more i should tell . 
i met people in all wal@@ ks of life , so many of them did what they loved , living on the bor@@ ders of the possible . 
and although i gradu@@ ated , i realized that i could not sett@@ le for a career in law . 
there had to be another piece of the puzz@@ le . 
and at the same time i realized that it &apos;s okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a new@@ com@@ er , fresh in the picture - and not just okay , but something to be gra@@ te@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat . 
because belo@@ n@@ ging to it can easily lead to the collapse of horizon@@ s , so easily can mean accep@@ ting the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment . 
i am now well enough out of my comfort zone to know that , yes , the world break@@ s apart , but not as you would expect . 
opportunities that were not allowed were exp@@ li@@ ci@@ tly encoura@@ ged . 
there was an energy , a rel@@ ent@@ less optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ milit@@ y and dar@@ ing . 
so i followed my bel@@ ly feeling . 
i gather@@ ed a small team of people around me for whom the dra@@ wer &quot; does not work &quot; an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge . 
for a year we did not have a cent . 
at the end of each day i coo@@ ked a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p , which we shared . 
we worked until late at night . 
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant ones and we made the break@@ through . 
i made the decision to move to the usa 
after only one trip there . 
my bel@@ ly feeling again . 
three months later i moved and the ad@@ vent@@ ure continu@@ ed . 
before i finish the lec@@ ture , i would like to tell you about my grandmother . 
she grew up at a time when conf@@ u@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ari@@ n the most important person . 
life had not changed for cent@@ ur@@ ies . 
her father died shor@@ tly after she was born . 
her mother raised her alone . 
at 17 , she became the second wife of a mand@@ ari@@ n whose mother beat her . 
without the support of her husband , she caused a sen@@ sation by bringing him to cour@@ t and being a pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tor in her own case , and an even greater sen@@ sation than she won . 
&quot; it does not work &quot; pro@@ ved un@@ true . 
i was sho@@ wer@@ ing in a hotel room in sy@@ dney when she died . 10@@ 00 km away in mel@@ bo@@ ur@@ ne . 
i looked through the sho@@ wer parti@@ tion and saw her standing on the other side . 
i knew she had come to say goo@@ d@@ by@@ e . 
my mother called me a few minutes later . 
a few days later we went to a budd@@ hi@@ st temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ray and sat around her c@@ offi@@ n . 
we told her stories and assu@@ red her that we were still with her . 
at mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and said he had to close the c@@ offi@@ n . 
my mother asked us to touch her hand . 
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her so col@@ d@@ ? &quot; 
&quot; because they have been holding them since this morning &quot; , he said . 
&quot; they did not let go@@ &quot; . 
if there is a band in our family , then it goes through the women . 
if we see who we were and how life sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have got in the way . 
the de@@ fe@@ at would have been too easy . 
now i would like to have my own children , and i still remember the boat . 
who would ever want one@@ ? 
yes , i am afraid of privi@@ leg@@ es , of ligh@@ t@@ ness , of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment to a licen@@ se . 
can i give you a bu@@ g in your life that bra@@ vely bra@@ ves every wave , the un@@ deter@@ red , ste@@ ad@@ y ch@@ ug@@ ging of the engine , the wide hori@@ zon that guar@@ ant@@ ee@@ s not@@ hin@@ g@@ ? 
i don@@ t know . 
but if i could give this and get it through safe@@ ly , i would do it . 
be@@ sides , tan@@ s mother is here today in the fourth or fif@@ th row . 
i am here to share my photograph@@ y with you . 
is it photograph@@ y at all@@ ? 
because that is of course a picture that you can not record with his camera . 
ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , my interest in photograph@@ y began when i got my first digital camera , at the age of fif@@ te@@ en . 
i combin@@ ed it with my previous love for drawing , but it was a bit different , because when using the camera , the process was much more in the planning . 
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger . 
for me , photograph@@ y seemed more about being in the right place at the right time . 
i thought everyone could do that . 
so i wanted to create something else , something in which the process begins when the tri@@ g@@ ger is pres@@ sed . 
photos like thi@@ s@@ : a construction site along a bus@@ y street . 
but it has an un@@ expected twi@@ st . 
and still keep a reali@@ stic level . 
or photos like these - dark and color@@ ful at the same time , but all with the common goal of keeping a reali@@ stic level . 
when i say reality , i mean photo@@ -@@ reality . 
because , of course , it is not something that you can really capture , but i always want to make it look as if you could have , in a photo . 
photos where you have to think for a moment to find out the trick . 
it &apos;s more about cat@@ ching an idea than a moment . 
but what is the trick that makes it look reali@@ sti@@ c@@ ? 
is it about the details or the color@@ s@@ ? 
is it about the ligh@@ t@@ ? 
what does the illusion crea@@ te@@ ? 
sometimes the perspective is the illusion . 
but ultimately it &apos;s about how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be made tan@@ gi@@ ble on a two-@@ dimensional surface . 
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s reali@@ stic , but what we think is reali@@ stic . 
so i think the bas@@ ics are very simple . 
i see it as a puzz@@ le of reality , where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality . 
and let me show you a simple example . 
here we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects that we can all identify with in a %three-dimensional world . 
but combin@@ ed in a certain way , they can create something that still looks %three-dimensional , as if it could exist . 
but at the same time we know that that is not possible . 
so we out@@ smart our brains , because our brain simply does not accept that it does not really make sense . 
and i see the same process in combin@@ ing photos . 
it &apos;s really just about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties . 
so the things that make a picture look reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things we do not think about , the things around us in our everyday lives . 
but when we combin@@ e photos , it &apos;s really important to remember , because otherwise they just look wrong somehow . 
i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a reali@@ stic result . 
as you can see , these are not three special pictures . 
combin@@ ed but you can create something special like this . 
the first rule is that combin@@ ed photos should have the same perspective . 
secon@@ dly , combin@@ ed photos should have the same ligh@@ ting style . 
and these two pictures meet these two requi@@ re@@ ments - sho@@ ot@@ ing from the same hei@@ ght and the same ligh@@ ting . 
thir@@ dly , it is about making it impossible to distin@@ gui@@ sh where the individual images begin and end by connec@@ ting them se@@ am@@ less@@ ly . 
makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together . 
by bl@@ end@@ ing color , contra@@ st and bri@@ ght@@ ness along the ed@@ ges with individual images , add@@ ing photograph@@ ic fla@@ ws such as dep@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and dist@@ urban@@ ces , we blu@@ r the boundar@@ ies between the different images and make them look like a single photo , even though there are basically hundreds of images can cont@@ ain from levels . 
here is another example . 
one may think that this is just a landscape picture , and the lower part has been manipu@@ lat@@ ed . 
this picture is in reality completely com@@ posed , from photos of different places . 
i personally think that . that it is easier to create a place than to find a place , because you do not have to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head . 
but it requires a lot of planning . 
and when i got that idea in the winter , i knew that i would need several months to plan it , find the different places for the pieces of the puzz@@ le . 
for example , the fish was taken on a fishing trip . 
the shor@@ e comes from a different place . 
the under@@ water part comes from a quar@@ ry . 
and yes , i even changed the house red on the top of the island to make it look more swe@@ dis@@ h . 
in order to achieve a reali@@ stic result , it goes from planning to planning . 
i always start with a ske@@ tch , an idea . 
then it &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of the different pictures . 
and here each piece is very well plan@@ ned . 
and then , when you make good sho@@ ts , the result can be pretty nice , and also quite reali@@ stic . 
so all the tools are there , and the only thing that limit@@ s us is our imagination . 
many thanks . 
i would like to discus@@ s with you why so many electr@@ onic health projects fail . 
and i think the key point is that we stopped talking to our patients . 
and one of the things we introduced at rad@@ b@@ oud university was to hir@@ e a main listen@@ er . 
she does not do anything scienti@@ fically - she puts down a cu@@ p of coffee or te@@ a and asks patients , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how are you ? &quot; 
how can we help you@@ ? &quot; 
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all - maybe most of the electr@@ onic health projects fail@@ : because we stopped listening . 
this is my w@@ lan@@ -@@ scale . a very simple thing . 
she has a butt@@ on , on / off . 
and every morning i jump on it . 
and yes , i have a task , as you may realize . 
i have set my task at 95 k@@ g . 
it works very simpl@@ e@@ : every time i jump on the sc@@ ales , she also sen@@ ds my data to google health . 
and there they are also called by my general prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er , so that he can recognize where my weight problem lies , and not just in the moment in which i need car@@ di@@ a@@ c support or so , but also with a look into the past . 
but there is something else . 
maybe you know , i have over 4@@ ,000 follo@@ wers on twitter . 
so every morning i jump on my w@@ lan@@ -@@ scale and the people talk to me before i &apos;m in the car@@ : &quot; for lunch rather only a small sal@@ ad today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot; 
but that &apos;s the ni@@ ce@@ st thing that can happen , because this is the group pressure , group pressure to help patients , because that could be used against ob@@ es@@ ity , or it could qui@@ t patient smo@@ king . 
but it could also be used to get people out of their cha@@ irs and get them to play some kind of game together to better control their health . 
from next week on the market comes . 
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or so . 
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , send it to their doctor and share it with others , for just over $ 100 . 
at this point , the patients come into play . not only can you reg@@ ain control , cap@@ tain on your own ship , but you can also help us with health care in the face of the challenges ahead , as well as the cost explosion of health care , double demand , and so on . 
make metho@@ ds that are easy to use and begin to embra@@ ce patients in a team . 
and you can do that through such metho@@ ds , but also through crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing . 
and one of the things we did is i want to share with you through a short video . 
we have all navi@@ gation systems in our cars . 
maybe even in our cell phones . 
we know exactly where all at@@ ms are lo@@ cated around ma@@ ast@@ rich@@ t . 
we still know one thing , where all pe@@ tro@@ l stati@@ ons are . 
and clearly , we can find fast food cha@@ ins . 
but where would the next a@@ ed be to help this pati@@ ent@@ ? 
we asked around , and nobody knew . 
nobody knew where the next life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was to be found in that moment . 
so what did we do@@ ? we have done crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the net@@ her@@ lands . 
we &apos;ve built an internet site and asked a crowd , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please tell us where he is , when he &apos;s up , &quot; because sometimes it is closed during business hours , of course . 
and over 10,000 a@@ ed@@ s have been repor@@ ted in the net@@ her@@ lands . 
the next step was to find the app@@ s for it . 
and we designed an i@@ pad ap@@ p . 
we have developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ mented reality to find these a@@ ed@@ s . 
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ ast@@ rich@@ t and someone break@@ s down , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , your microsoft phone to find the next a@@ ed that can save lives . 
and from today we want to introduce this not only as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , as the product calls itself , but also as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us . 
and we want to bring this to a global level . 
and we are asking our colleagues from all over the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us act like kno@@ ts to crow@@ d@@ source these a@@ ed@@ s around the world . 
and when you are on vac@@ ation and someone break@@ s down , be it your own ki@@ n or anyone else , you can find such an a@@ ed . 
the other thing we would like to ask is that companies around the world help us confi@@ r@@ m these a@@ ed@@ s . 
these could be cour@@ ier services , or techni@@ cians , for example , just to make sure the a@@ ed repor@@ ted is still in its place . 
please help us with this and try not only to improve your health , but also to take it into your own hands . 
many thanks . 
today i will report un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies . 
i work in the solar technology industry . 
and my little star@@ tu@@ p wants us to force ourselves to protect the environment by . . . 
. . . paying attention to crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing . 
here is a short video about what we do . 
oh . one moment . 
it may take time for it to load . 
well - we can just ski@@ p that - i &apos;ll just ski@@ p the video instead . . . 
no . 
this is not . . . 
okay . 
solar technology is . . . 
oh , my time is over@@ ? 
okay . many thanks . 
so a few years ago i started a program to get the stars in engineering and design to take a year off and work in an environment that is pretty much anything they hate , we have them in the government let work . 
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the peace cor@@ ps for computer fre@@ ak@@ s . 
we sele@@ ct a few fel@@ lo@@ ws each year and we let them work with city admini@@ stra@@ tions . 
instead of sending you to the third world , we send you to to@@ w@@ n@@ houses . 
and there they developed great app@@ s , worked with urban co-@@ workers . 
but what you really do is to show what technology can do today . 
so they meet al . 
al is a hy@@ dra@@ nt in the city of boston . 
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is someone who sho@@ vels him off when he &apos;s s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fire@@ fighting when covered by a meter of s@@ now is . 
how did he come to see@@ k help in this particular wa@@ y@@ ? 
last year we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston in the &quot; code for america &quot; program . 
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot last febru@@ ary . 
and they realized that the city never sho@@ vels these hy@@ dr@@ ants free . 
but one particular fellow , a man named eri@@ k micha@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ er , noticed something else and that was that the resi@@ dents were free to sho@@ vel the si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of them . 
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p . 
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a hy@@ dra@@ nt . 
you agree to sho@@ vel it free@@ ly when it &apos;s s@@ no@@ wing . 
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he named the first al . 
if you do not , someone can take it away from you . 
so there is a nice little game dynam@@ ics . 
this is a mod@@ est little ap@@ p . 
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year . 
but it does something that no other government technology does . 
it is spre@@ ading rapi@@ dly . 
there is this guy in the i .@@ t . department of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who has seen that he could use this ap@@ p , not for s@@ now , but for citizens to adop@@ t tsun@@ ami si@@ ren@@ s . 
it is very important that these tsun@@ ami si@@ ren@@ s work , but people ste@@ al the batter@@ ies . 
so he got the citizens to check them . 
and then se@@ attle decided to use the ap@@ p to get the citizens to clean the clo@@ g@@ ged gul@@ lies . 
and chicago has just introduced them so people can clear the si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it &apos;s s@@ no@@ wing . 
we now know nine cities planning to use this ap@@ p . 
and it has been spre@@ ading smo@@ ot@@ hl@@ y , organi@@ cally , of course . 
if you know about government technology , you know it does not usually work that way . 
the pro@@ cur@@ ement of software usually takes a few years . 
we had a team working on a project in boston last year that took three people two and a half months . 
it was about a way for parents to find out what the right public schools are for their children . 
we were later told that if it were to go through the normal chan@@ nel@@ s , it would have taken over two years and it would have cost over two million dollars . 
and that &apos;s nothing . 
there is currently a project in california justice that has cost tax@@ pay@@ ers $ 2 billion so far , and it &apos;s not working . 
and there are projects like this on every level of the government . 
so an ap@@ p that is written in a few days , and then spre@@ ads by itself , is a kind of shot in front of the bu@@ g on the institution of the government . 
it shows how the government could work better - no longer as a private company , as many people think it should . 
and not even like a technology company , but more like the internet itself . 
and that means free access , that means open and productive . 
and that &apos;s important . 
but more important about this ap@@ p is that it represents a new generation that tac@@ kle@@ s the government &apos;s problem - not as the problem of a fossi@@ li@@ zed institution , but as a problem of collective action . 
and that is a very good news , because it shows that we are very good at the collective action with digital technology . 
now there is a large community of people who make the tools we need to effectively tac@@ kle things together . 
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people across the country who get up and write government app@@ s every day in their own communities . 
they did not give up the government . 
they are terri@@ bly fru@@ strated with her , but they do not comp@@ la@@ in , they fix her . 
and these people know something we have lost sight of . 
and that is when you forget all your feelings about politics and the que@@ u@@ es at the emplo@@ y@@ ment office and all the other things we are really up@@ set about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ ; rei@@ ll@@ y , &quot; what we do together , that we can not do alone . &quot; 
today , a lot of people have given up the government . 
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you to think about it because things are changing . 
the policy does not chan@@ ge@@ ; the government is changing . 
and because the government ultimately dra@@ ws its strength from us - reme@@ m@@ ber@@ : &quot; we the peop@@ le@@ ? &quot; - how we think about it will influence how this change happens . 
i did not know much about government when i started this program . 
and like many people , i thought that government is main@@ ly about choo@@ sing people to be in office . 
now , after two years , i have come to the conclu@@ sion that it is main@@ ly with kom@@ mu@@ nen , to ba@@ g lo@@ vers . 
this is the call center for service and information . 
you usually come out there when you call 3@@ 11 in your city . 
if you ever had the chance to work in your urban call center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man as part of the program - in fact , do it all - you will see the people , the government , because of many call various problems , including that a bag@@ ga@@ ge rat in your house . 
so scot@@ t gets this call . 
he types &quot; bag@@ -@@ rat &quot; in the offi@@ cial dat@@ ab@@ ase . 
and he does not really have an idea . he starts with the animal cat@@ cher . 
and finally he sa@@ y@@ s@@ : &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors in your house and play lou@@ d music and see if the cat@@ tle are fall@@ ing off@@ ? &quot; 
and that worked . appl@@ ause for scot@@ t . 
but that was not the end of the ba@@ g lo@@ vers . 
boston does not just have a call center . 
it has an ap@@ p , a web and mobile ap@@ p called &quot; citizens connect &quot; , 
we did not write this ap@@ p . 
this is the work of very smart people in the office of &quot; new urban mechan@@ ics &quot; in boston . 
one day - this is an actual report - this came in@@ : &quot; ba@@ g rat in my gar@@ bag@@ e can . can not say if she is dead . 
how can i get it re@@ mov@@ ed@@ ? &quot; 
but what about &quot; citizens connect &quot; happened is different . 
scot@@ t talked from person to person . 
but on &quot; citizens connect &quot; everything is public so everyone can see it . 
and in this case , it saw a neighb@@ or . 
and the next ent@@ ry we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the gar@@ bag@@ e bin behind the house . 
bag@@ ga@@ ge rat@@ ? yes . ali@@ ve@@ ? y@@ ap . 
turned the gar@@ bag@@ e bin on the side . went home . 
good night , swe@@ et bag@@ -@@ rat . &quot; 
quite easy . 
that &apos;s great . here the digital meet@@ s the physical . 
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing . 
but it is also a great example of government as a platform . 
and i do not necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform here . 
i tend to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others . 
one citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but the government played a central role here . 
she jo@@ ined these two people . 
and they could have been lin@@ ked to government benefits if they were needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and che@@ aper alternative to government services . 
if one neighb@@ or helps another , we streng@@ then our communities . 
if we call the animal cat@@ cher , it costs a lot of money . 
one of the most important things is that we have to remember that government is not the same as politics . 
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other . 
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is the one to choose . 
how many times have we elec@@ ted a political leader - and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader - and then we sit back and expect the government to refle@@ ct our values ​​and meet our needs , and then has not much chan@@ ge@@ d@@ ? 
that &apos;s because the government is like a far ocean and politics that &apos;s the top 15@@ c@@ m . 
and what is underneath is what we call bur@@ e@@ au@@ cra@@ cy . 
and we use that word with such cont@@ emp@@ t . 
but it is this cont@@ emp@@ t that makes them that we pos@@ se@@ ss , and for which we pay , let something that works against us , something else , and then we dise@@ m@@ power ourselves . 
people seem to think politics is sex@@ y . 
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bur@@ e@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y . 
because that &apos;s where the real government work takes place . 
we have to get involved in the machin@@ ery of the government . 
so the occu@@ py@@ these movement has done it . 
have you seen these gu@@ y@@ s@@ ? 
it is a group of worried citizens who have written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report that respon@@ ds to the se@@ c@@ -@@ mem@@ o on the financial re@@ form bill . 
that &apos;s not being politi@@ cally active , that &apos;s being bur@@ e@@ au@@ cra@@ tic . 
well , for those of us who have given up the government , it is time we thought about the world we want to leave for our children . 
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to face . 
do we really believe that we are achie@@ ving what we need to achieve without impro@@ ving the one institution that can act on be@@ half of all of us@@ ? 
a government is absolutely necessary , but it must become more efficient . 
the good news is that technology makes it possible to fundament@@ ally re@@ interpre@@ t the government &apos;s function in ways that can actually achieve something by em@@ power@@ ing society . 
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and they know it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you just have to build the right systems . 
now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so unfortunately i am almost a generation older than most of them . 
this is a generation that grew up to take their voice for gran@@ ted . 
they do not fight this fight , which we all fight , therefore , who is allowed to speak@@ ; they are all allowed to speak . 
you can express your opini@@ on on every chan@@ nel at any time , and you do it . 
so , when face@@ d with the government &apos;s problem , they do not care so much about using their voices . 
they use their hands . 
they use their hands to write appli@@ cations that improve the work of the government . 
and these app@@ s let us use our hands to improve our communities . 
that could be to sho@@ vel a hy@@ dra@@ nt , wee@@ d wee@@ d , turn a tra@@ sh can with a bag@@ -@@ rat . 
and sure , we could have sho@@ vel@@ ed these hy@@ dr@@ ants all the time , and many people do that . 
but these app@@ s are like little digital remin@@ ders that we are not just consum@@ ers , and we are not just government consum@@ ers who pay tax@@ es and recei@@ ve benefits . 
we are more than that , we are citizens . 
and we will not improve the government until we improve citi@@ zen@@ ship . 
so the question i have for you all her@@ e@@ : when it comes to the big , important things we need to do together , all together , will we be just a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands to@@ o@@ ? 
thank you . 
normally , my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming to be will be . and i thought , since i am here with friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also trying to look back and understand what is really going on , with those incredible lea@@ ps forward that are so swi@@ ft that we can bar@@ ely keep up . 
i &apos;ll start by showing you a single , bor@@ ing slide . 
. . . could you please brie@@ fly show the slide . 
this is a fo@@ il , which i have cho@@ sen rand@@ om@@ ly from my fol@@ der . 
i am not concerned with the details of the film , but rather with the general form . 
this slide shows data from an analysis by us of the performance of ris@@ c process@@ ors compared to the performance of a local area network . 
the interesting thing here is that this film , like some of the others that we often en@@ coun@@ ter in our field , is a kind of straight on a %semi-logarithmic cur@@ ve . 
in other wor@@ d@@ s@@ : every step here cor@@ respon@@ ds to a potential in the performance scale . 
and that is a no@@ vel@@ ty that we have to use this type scale on %semi-logarithmic cur@@ ves in the field of technology . 
something very strange happens here . 
that &apos;s essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here . 
so , if you could turn the light on again . 
a little ligh@@ ter , because i &apos;ll draw something on the paper here . 
well , why do we draw graph@@ s in technology on %semi-logarithmic cur@@ ves@@ ? 
the reason for this is if i would draw it on a normal cur@@ ve , where , say , this is the years , so the ti@@ mel@@ ine of a kind , and this is any measure of technology that i want to plo@@ t with a graph , then the graph will be sil@@ ly . 
they look like this . 
and that does not tell us much . 
if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transport technology , that would be very un@@ reas@@ on@@ able on the %semi-logarithmic scale , in the form of a flat line . 
but if something like this happens , then it changes the quali@@ ta@@ tive circum@@ stances . 
so , if the transport technology pro@@ gr@@ essed as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or technology , then the day after tomorrow we could get into a tax@@ i and in 30 seconds we would be in to@@ k@@ yo . 
but that does not work so fast . 
this has never happened before in the history of technology development , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth that exponenti@@ ally increas@@ es in size every few years . 
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you see , they do not go on forever . 
it is not possible that everything will evol@@ ve forever and ever as fast as now . 
there are two possibilities : 
it will either turn into a classi@@ c s cur@@ ve like this , until something completely new comes along , or it will happen here . 
that &apos;s about it . 
well , i &apos;m optimis@@ tic , so i think something like this is going to happen here . 
is that really how it is , then that means we are in the middle of a transition right now . 
we are here on this line , in a transition from the previous world to a new kind of world . 
so the question that i would like to ask , and i often ask myself , is how this new world will be@@ ? 
what is this new state that the world is slowly taking on@@ ? 
because the transition seems to be very , very conf@@ using when you are in the middle of it . 
when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in the year 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 . 
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you realize that the future is still in the year 2000 . 
we can not go further than that . 
in other words , the future has sh@@ run@@ k by a year each year since i was in this world . 
i think the reason for that is that we realize that something is going on . 
the transition happens . we can all feel it . 
and we know that at the moment it just does not make sense to try to look 30 or 50 years into the future because everything will be so different that a simple extra@@ pol@@ ation from what we do now just does not make sense . 
i would like to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are currently . 
to do this i will first talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers . 
because i believe that in order to really understand this we need to step back and look at the matter on a longer time scale . 
i want to look at this on the ti@@ me@@ scale of earth &apos;s life . 
i think the over@@ all picture makes sense , if you divi@@ de it into a few billi@@ on-@@ steps . 
so let &apos;s go back , 2.@@ 5 billion years . the earth was a large , ster@@ il@@ e lu@@ mp of rock with many chemicals flo@@ ating on it . 
now , looking at the way these chemicals were organized , this gives us a pretty good picture of how they did it . 
i believe , too , there are theor@@ ies that begin to understand how everything started with r@@ na , but i will tell you a simpli@@ fied story of it that at that time there were small oil dro@@ ple@@ ts flo@@ ating around , con@@ tain@@ ing various types of chemical form@@ ul@@ ations . 
some of these oil dro@@ ple@@ ts con@@ tain@@ ed a special combin@@ ation of chemicals that allowed them to integr@@ ate other chemicals from the outside and th@@ us grow . 
everyone who was like that began to spli@@ t up . 
these small dro@@ ple@@ ts of oil were in their sense the most primi@@ tive cell form . 
however , these oil dro@@ ple@@ ts were not alive in the present sense , because each of them was just a small , acci@@ dent@@ al reci@@ pe of chemicals . 
and every time it spli@@ t , the chemicals in it have become un@@ ev@@ en@@ ly distribu@@ ted . 
so every dro@@ ple@@ t was a little different . 
in fact , the dro@@ ple@@ ts that had a com@@ position that was more opti@@ mal for growth grew faster than others and integr@@ ated more and more chemicals from the outside and part@@ ed faster . 
so they ten@@ ded to survive longer and they multi@@ pli@@ ed to a greater exten@@ t . 
so that &apos;s just a very simple chemical form of life , but it gets more interesting when these dro@@ ple@@ ts learn a trick about abstra@@ ction . 
in some way , which we still do not quite understand , these dro@@ ple@@ ts have learned the ability to write down information . 
they have learned to save the cell &apos;s reci@@ pe as information . in a certain chemical form , which we call dna . 
in other words , in this min@@ d@@ less , evolutionary way , they have found a way that allowed them to write down what they were made of , so that this information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ ie@@ d . 
the amazing thing is that this kind of information stor@@ age rema@@ ined the same for over 2.@@ 5 billion years in which it was created . 
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , consi@@ sts of the exac@@ t same code and the same sp@@ elling . 
every crea@@ ture uses exactly the same letters and the same code . 
we are ready to write something in this code for the sa@@ ke of pleasure . 
and here i have 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of a white po@@ w@@ der , which i try to keep away from security person@@ nel in air@@ port@@ s . 
in it is - what i &apos;ve done , i &apos;ve taken this code - the code consi@@ sts of normal letters , which we use to symbo@@ li@@ ze - and i have written my business card on a piece of dna and have streng@@ the@@ ned it 10 ^ 22 times . 
so if someone wants one hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here . 
if i had been a sel@@ fish person in reality , i would have written you on a virus and rele@@ ased it into the room . 
so what &apos;s the next ste@@ p@@ ? 
writing down the dna was an interesting step . 
and that &apos;s what these cells did - that made them happy for another billion years . 
but then another , very interesting step happened where the things became completely different . in fact , these cells began to communicate and share information , creating communities of cells . 
i do not know if you already knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna . 
that is also the reason why , for example , the resi@@ stance to antibio@@ tics grow@@ s . 
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and have written this information along with other bacteria into the dna and now we have lots of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in because the bacteria communicate with each other . 
this communication now allowed the foun@@ ding of communities , which in some sense were in the same bo@@ at@@ ; they were syn@@ er@@ ge@@ tic . 
th@@ us they either survi@@ ved together or they went under together . this meant that when a community was successful , all of the community &apos;s individuals were repe@@ ated more often and favor@@ ed by evolution . 
the transition point is now where these communities moved so close together that they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the whole community in a string on the dna . 
and the next interesting phase las@@ ted about another billion years . 
at this time , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of many different types of cells , which together function as a single organis@@ m . 
in fact , we are also such a multi-@@ cell@@ ular community . 
we have many cells that are no longer on their own . 
your skin cells are use@@ less without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on . 
so these communities began to evol@@ ve , so that the plane on which the evolution took place was no longer the single cell , but the whole cell@@ ular community , which we call organis@@ m . 
the next step was now within these communities . 
the cell communities began to abstra@@ ct information again . 
and they developed special structures that did nothing other than process information within the organis@@ m . 
and these are the neur@@ al structures . 
the nerv@@ e cells are th@@ us the information process@@ ing appar@@ at@@ us these cell communities have built up . 
they started training speci@@ alists within the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and re@@ tain@@ ing information . 
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities . 
this gave them an evolutionary advantage . 
because at this point in time , individual learning now occur@@ red within the life spa@@ n of a single organis@@ m rather than over that evolutionary time spa@@ n . 
for example , an organis@@ m could learn not to eat a particular fru@@ it because it tas@@ ted bad and made it sick the last time he ate it . 
this could be done within the lifetime of a single organis@@ m , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago were needed , because this information had to be learned evolution@@ arily from the individuals who died because of this fru@@ it , since these information process@@ ing structures were not yet available . 
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process using these special information structures because evolution could now take place within an individual . 
it could take place within a tempor@@ al learning frame@@ work . 
what happened after that was that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other . 
as an example , the most re@@ fin@@ ed version of this type of communication known to us is the human language . 
it &apos;s quite a star@@ t@@ ling invention if you think about it . 
i have a very complicated , mess@@ y and conf@@ used idea in my head . 
i sit here and basically make gr@@ un@@ ting notes of mine , hop@@ ing to create a simil@@ arly conf@@ used idea in your head that has a certain simil@@ ari@@ ty to my original idea . 
so we take something very complicated , trans@@ forming it into sounds , a sequence of sounds , producing something very complicated in the minds of others . 
this allows us to function as a single organis@@ m again . 
and what we have actually done , we , humanity , is , we have be@@ gun to abstra@@ ct . 
we go through the same sta@@ ges that multi@@ cell@@ ular organisms have gone through - the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ ds , how we record , present , process data . 
the invention of the language , for example , was a small step in this direction . 
tele@@ pho@@ ny , computers , video ta@@ pes , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we have built in our community to hand@@ le this information . 
and it connec@@ ts us all together to something much bigger , and also able to evol@@ ve faster than we have been before . 
no@@ wa@@ days evolution can happen in the period of micro@@ seconds . 
you have also seen ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he has a bit of evolution in the &quot; con@@ volu@@ tion &quot; program has shown right in front of your eyes . 
so now we &apos;ve acceler@@ ated the ti@@ me@@ scale again . 
the first steps in the story i told you took a billion years a@@ piece . 
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , las@@ ted several hundred million years . 
then the next steps , such as language and so on , took less than a million years . 
and these next steps , like electro@@ ni@@ cs , seem to take only a few decades . 
the process feed@@ s on itself and th@@ us , i think , auto@@ -@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it - if something increas@@ es its rate of change . 
the more it changes , the faster it changes . 
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explo@@ sive turn . 
we see the process that feed@@ s on itself . 
i live profession@@ ally from building computers and i know that i could not use the mechanis@@ m i use to build computers without the recent advan@@ ces in computer technology . 
my current job is to design objects of such high complexity that it is impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense . 
i do not know what each transi@@ sto@@ r does in the connection machine . 
it has billions of those . 
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking machines do , is , we think on a certain level of abstra@@ ction , hand@@ ing it over to the machine , and the machine makes it something that far sur@@ pas@@ ses our cap@@ abilities , better and faster than we ever do could . 
and she does it part@@ ly with metho@@ ds that we do not even understand right now . 
a method that is particularly interesting , and which l have often used lat@@ ely , is evolution itself . 
we instal@@ l an evolutionary process in the machine , which run@@ s in the micro@@ scale range . 
to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that evol@@ ves from random instru@@ ctions . 
we say , &quot; computer , please generate one hundred million random sequen@@ ces of instru@@ ctions . 
now please ex@@ ecu@@ te all these rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ sen instru@@ ctions , ex@@ ecu@@ te all the programs , and finally choose those that are clo@@ se@@ st to my speci@@ fi@@ cations . &quot; 
so in other words , i first define what i want . 
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , that would be a simple example i &apos;ve already used for that . 
so find programs , which can sort the most likely numbers . 
of course , the chance of rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ sen instru@@ ctions being very small is that they sort rand@@ om@@ ly by numbers , so probably none of the instru@@ ctions will actually do that . 
but one of them may , with lu@@ ck , put two numbers in the right order . 
now i say , &quot; computer , now take those 10@@ % of the sequen@@ ces that have come clo@@ se@@ st to my pur@@ pos@@ es . 
save this , del@@ et@@ e the rest . 
now re@@ produce all the le@@ ft@@ over ones that have sor@@ ted the numbers best . 
nam@@ ely with a method of re@@ combin@@ ing , analog@@ ous to re@@ production . &quot; 
take two programs and you produce children through the exchange of their sub@@ rou@@ tin@@ es , and the children in@@ her@@ it the fe@@ atures of the sub@@ rou@@ tin@@ es from the two programs . 
so now i have a new generation of programs created by combin@@ ing programs that have come a bit closer to what they are . 
say , &quot; please repe@@ at this process . &quot; 
she rates again . 
maybe introduce some mu@@ tations . 
and try the whole thing again with another generation . 
all these generations take only a few milli@@ seconds 
and so i can go through millions of years of evolution in less than a few minutes . or in more complicated cases , some hours . 
in the end i get programs that can sort numbers perfectly . 
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever have written by hand . 
when i look at these programs then i can not say how they work . 
i tried to understand her . 
they are kin@@ ky and strange programs . 
but you do the job . 
i know and am quite sure that you will do the job because you come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job . 
because her life depen@@ ded on her doing the job right . 
i once sat in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ vi@@ n min@@ sky when he pulled out a card and said , &quot; oh look , look at that . 
there it is , &apos;@@ ; this plane consi@@ sts of hundreds of thousands of small parts that work together to make your flight safe@@ r . &apos;@@ ; does not that make you more confi@@ dent@@ ? &quot; 
we know that a development process is not opti@@ mal if it gets too complicated . 
so we start to rely on computers , for a process that is very different from the classi@@ cal engineering . 
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal metho@@ ds would allow us to produce . 
and yet we do not quite understand the possibilities of it . 
so to speak , technology out@@ stri@@ ps us . 
we now use these programs to make the computers much faster so that we are able to perfor@@ m these processes even faster . 
so there is a feedback . 
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so conf@@ using . 
because all of today &apos;s new technologies feed on themselves . 
we take off . 
we have reach@@ ed a point that is analog@@ ous to the time when sing@@ le-@@ cell organisms evolved into multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms . 
so we are the amo@@ e@@ ba@@ s and we still can not quite figure out what hell we are actually creating here . 
we are in the middle of this transition point . 
but i really believe that something is coming after us . 
i find it very hau@@ ght@@ y to say that we are the end product of evolution . 
and i think we all are part of the creation of whatever comes next . 
well , lunch is coming up and i think i &apos;ll stop here now , before i &apos;m even picked out . 
my story starts right here in ra@@ ja@@ sth@@ an , about two years ago . 
i was under the star@@ ry sky in the desert together with su@@ fi sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ ht@@ i@@ ar al@@ i . 
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian epi@@ c &quot; ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot; 
if we wanted to travel back then , we jum@@ ped into a car and whi@@ zz@@ ed across the sky . 
now we do it with planes . 
at that time , when the great indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce ar@@ jun@@ a thir@@ sty , he took a bo@@ w , shot into the ground and water came out . 
now we do it with dr@@ ills and machines . 
we came to the conclu@@ sion that magic and magic were re@@ placed by machines . 
that really made me sad . 
i got a bit afraid of technology . 
it sc@@ ared me that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun@@ set without a camera and without tw@@ ee@@ t to my friends . 
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill . 
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch . 
this piece of 50 year old technology became the most mag@@ ical thing for me . 
it became a gold@@ en gat@@ e@@ way to a world of pir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ wr@@ ec@@ ked ships and imag@@ ery in my imagination . 
it seemed to me that our smart wat@@ ches and c@@ ameras kept us from dre@@ aming . 
they kept us from being inspired . 
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic possible rather than kill it . 
i began to illu@@ strate books when i was 16 years old . 
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a story@@ -@@ telling device that can connect read@@ ers all over the world . 
it knows how we hold it . 
it can know where we are . 
it brings together images and text , anima@@ tion , sounds and touch . 
the story@@ telling uses more and more sen@@ ses . 
but what do we do with it@@ ? 
i &apos;m just going to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p . 
it says , &quot; put your finger@@ s in every light . &quot; 
and so - it says , &quot; this box belo@@ n@@ gs . . . &quot; i write my name . 
and i become a figure in the book . 
now and then a letter falls down for me - and the i@@ pad knows by gps where i live - which is cor@@ rec@@ tly add@@ ressed to me . 
the child in me is really excited about such possibilities . 
i talked a lot about magic . 
i &apos;m not refer@@ ring to mag@@ i@@ cians and dra@@ gon@@ s , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children . 
i always found fire@@ flies in a glass very exciting . 
so you have to ti@@ lt the i@@ pad here and let out the fire@@ fly . 
and they illu@@ min@@ ate the way through the rest of the book . 
another idea that fascin@@ ated me as a kid is that a whole galaxy can be stuck in a single mar@@ ble . 
and therefore here every book and every world becomes a little mar@@ ble , which i draw here to the magic device in the device . 
and this open@@ s a map . 
fanta@@ sy books have always had cards , but these cards were stati@@ c . 
this card grow@@ s and shi@@ nes and ser@@ ves as an ori@@ entation in the rest of the book . 
it also shows in other parts of the book . 
i &apos;m going in here . 
also it is important for me to create something that is indian but also very con@@ temporary . 
these are the ap@@ sar@@ as . 
we &apos;ve all heard of fair@@ ies and n@@ y@@ mp@@ h@@ s , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as@@ ? 
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as were tra@@ pped in in@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cham@@ bers for thousands of years , in an old mus@@ ty book . 
and we bring them back , in a con@@ temporary story for children . 
a story that dea@@ ls with new issues , such as the environmental crisis . 
on the top@@ ic of environmental cris@@ es , a big problem for the last 10 years is that children sit in their rooms , at their computers , without going out . 
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children to the natural world with their technology . 
in an interaction of the book you will be sent on a search . you have to go out and collect pictures of natural objects with the i@@ pad &apos;s camera . 
as a kid i had colle@@ ctions of stu@@ mp@@ s , rock@@ s , pe@@ b@@ bles and shel@@ ls . 
somehow the kids do not do that anymore . 
this childhood ritual is re@@ turned . you have to go out to take a picture of a flo@@ wer in a section and mark it . 
in another chap@@ ter you have to take a photo of a piece of tree bar@@ k and mark it . 
this is how you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photos that you can put online . 
a child in london shows the image of a fo@@ x and sa@@ y@@ s@@ : &quot; oh , today i saw a fo@@ x &quot; 
a child in india sa@@ y@@ s@@ : &quot; today i have seen a mon@@ key &quot; 
this creates a kind of social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photos that you have actually taken . 
there are a variety of ways to combin@@ e the world and technology . 
in the next book we plan an interaction using the video of the i@@ pad and see through aug@@ mented reality an anima@@ tion of el@@ ves appe@@ aring on a plant in front of the house . 
at one point , the screen fil@@ ls with leaves . 
you have to make the sound of the wind@@ s , blo@@ w them away and read the rest of the book . 
we are all moving toward a world where the forces of nature are getting closer to technology and where magic and technology can come closer . 
we use the energy of the sun . 
we bring our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story . 
many thanks . 
this is really an extraordinary honor for me . 
i spend most of my time with people in det@@ enti@@ on , pris@@ ons or death cells . 
i spend most of my time with the most soci@@ ally dis@@ advan@@ tag@@ ed in the hou@@ sing est@@ ates and places where there is a great deal of hop@@ ele@@ ss@@ ness . 
being here with ted , seeing and hearing how stimul@@ ating that is has given me a lot of power . 
in the short time here i realized one thin@@ g@@ : ted has an identity . 
you can say things here that have a worldwide influence . 
and sometimes , when something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and power that it would not otherwise have . 
i say that because i believe that identity is very important . 
we have seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations . 
i believe that we have learned that the words of a teacher are meaning@@ ful , but that the words of a de@@ dic@@ ated teacher are particularly meaning@@ ful . 
as a doctor , you can do good . but as a car@@ ing doctor you can do more . 
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity . 
by the way , i did not learn that in my job as a law@@ yer . 
i learned that from my grandmother . 
i grew up in a family , a traditional %african-american house@@ hold domin@@ ated by a matri@@ arc@@ h , and this matri@@ arc@@ h was my grandmother . 
she was a tough , strong woman , she had an effect . 
she had the last word in every family dis@@ pu@@ te . 
it was also the starting point of many dis@@ pu@@ tes in our family . 
she was the daughter of a sla@@ ve family . 
her parents were born sla@@ ves in virg@@ ini@@ a in the 18@@ 40@@ s . 
she was born around 18@@ 80 and the experience of sla@@ very sha@@ ped her world@@ view very much . 
my grandmother was strong , but she was also affec@@ tion@@ ate . 
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me . 
she squ@@ ee@@ zed me so hard that i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the . then she let me go . 
an hour or two later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you still feel my embra@@ ce@@ ? &quot; 
and when i said &quot; no@@ ,@@ &quot; she embra@@ ced me again . when i said yes , she left me alone . 
there was something about her that made you always want to be close to her . 
the only problem was that she had ten children . 
my mother was the yo@@ ung@@ est of her ten children . 
sometimes , when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention . 
my cous@@ ins ​​walked everywhere . 
i remember , i must have been eight or nine , that i wo@@ ke up one morning and went into the living room . all my cous@@ ins ​​walked around . 
my grandmother sat at the end of the room and star@@ ed at me . 
at first , i thought that was a game . 
i looked at her and sm@@ iled , but she looked very serious . 
that went 15 or 20 minutes . then she got up and came over to me . she took my hand and said , &quot; come , br@@ y@@ an . you and me , we have to talk . &quot; 
i still remember it as it was yesterday . 
i &apos;ll never forget it . 
she took me outside and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise that you will not pass it on . &quot; 
i said , &quot; i promise , grand@@ ma . &quot; 
she said , &quot; hon@@ or@@ ? &quot; i said yes . &quot; 
she put me down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot; 
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot; 
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot; 
i will never forget that . 
then she said , &quot; all you have to do is promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot; 
i said , &quot; ok , grand@@ ma . &quot; 
she said , &quot; first , promise me that you will always love your mu@@ m . &quot; 
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to promise that you will always take care of her . &quot; 
i wor@@ shi@@ ped my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grand@@ ma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot; 
then she said , &quot; next , promise me that you will always do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot; 
i thought about it and said , &quot; yes , grand@@ ma . i promise it . &quot; 
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is that you will never drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot; 
well , i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yes , grand@@ ma . i promise it . &quot; 
i grew up in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who is one year older and a sister one year yo@@ unger . 
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this six@@ pack bee@@ r with me grab@@ bed my sister and me and went with us in the woo@@ ds . 
we only fo@@ ol@@ ed there as usual . 
then he took a si@@ p of bee@@ r and off@@ ered one to my sister , and she accep@@ ted , and then they off@@ ered one to me . 
i said , &quot; no , no , no . already ok . you only do . i do not want bee@@ r . &quot; 
my brother said , &quot; go on . today we do that , you do everything else we do . 
i had something , your sister had something . go , have a bee@@ r . &quot; 
i said , &quot; i do not want to . you only do . you only do . &quot; 
my brother star@@ ed at me . 
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you@@ ? now have a drink . &quot; 
then he looked at my face and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not always crazy about talking to grand@@ ma@@ ? &quot; 
i said , &quot; what are you talking ab@@ out@@ ? &quot; 
he sa@@ i@@ d@@ : &quot; grand@@ ma tells all the grand@@ children that they are special . &quot; 
i was de@@ vas@@ tat@@ ed . 
i will conf@@ ess something to you . 
i probably should not do that . 
this may be broad@@ cast publi@@ cl@@ y . 
i am 5@@ 2 years old and i conf@@ ess that i have never dru@@ n@@ k a drop of al@@ co@@ hol before . 
i do not say that because i believe that it is virtu@@ ous . i say that because identity means power . 
when we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us that they initi@@ ally do not believe . 
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not do . 
of course my grandmother would tell all her grand@@ children that they are special . 
my grand@@ father was in ja@@ il during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion . 
my un@@ cle died from al@@ co@@ hol@@ -@@ indu@@ ced ill@@ nes@@ ses . 
and she believed that these were the issues we needed to address . 
i tried to say something about our jud@@ ic@@ ial system . 
this country is different than 40 years ago . 
in 197@@ 2 , 30@@ 0,000 people were in det@@ enti@@ on centers and in prison . 
today there are 2.@@ 3 million . 
the united states has the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate in the world today . 
seven million people are rele@@ ased on prob@@ ation or with condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . 
in my opini@@ on , mass imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ment has fundament@@ ally changed our world . 
in soci@@ ally de@@ priv@@ ed and black parts of the population , des@@ pair and hop@@ ele@@ ss@@ ness rei@@ g@@ n due to these changes . 
one in three male black@@ s between the ages of 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on pa@@ role or with condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . 
in urban communities across the country - from los angeles to phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington - 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , in prison , on pa@@ role or with condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . 
however , our system is not only sha@@ ped by issues of ra@@ cial aff@@ ili@@ ation , it is also dist@@ or@@ ted by poverty . 
we have a system of justice in this country that treat@@ s them much better when they are rich and gui@@ l@@ ty than poor and inno@@ cent . 
asse@@ ts , not deb@@ t , affect the result . 
ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , we seem to be completely satis@@ fied with that . 
a policy of fear and ange@@ r has convinced us that these issues are not our problems . 
we lost the contact . 
i think that &apos;s interesting . 
there are some exciting develop@@ ments . 
my home@@ town al@@ ab@@ ama perman@@ ently den@@ ies them the right to vote if they are con@@ vic@@ ted . 
here and now in al@@ ab@@ ama , 3@@ 4 percent of the black male population have perman@@ ently lost their vot@@ ing rights . 
in ten years &apos; time , we predict that the rate of re@@ vo@@ cation of civil rights of honor will be as high as before the adop@@ tion of the elec@@ tor@@ al law . 
sil@@ ence is dea@@ fen@@ ing . 
i represent children . 
many of my cli@@ ents are very young . 
the united states of america are the only country in the world con@@ dem@@ ning %thirteen-year-old children to death in prison . 
in this country , there are life sent@@ ences for children without condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . 
we have a lot of proce@@ dur@@ es already . 
the only country in the world . 
i represent people in death cells . 
the question of the death pen@@ alt@@ y is an interesting question . 
we believe that because we have been taught that the true question is this , does a person deser@@ ve to die for a crime commit@@ ted by him@@ ? 
that &apos;s a very sensitive question . 
but you can also think differently about it , depen@@ ding on how we see our identity . 
the other way of looking at things is not@@ : does anyone deser@@ ve death for a crime , bu@@ t@@ : did we deser@@ ve to kill@@ ? 
i find that fascinating . 
the death pen@@ alt@@ y in america is defined by mistake . 
on nine people we have ex@@ ecu@@ ted , one comes , whom we have found inno@@ cent , who was reli@@ ev@@ ed and rele@@ ased from the death cell . 
an amazing er@@ ror rate . one in nine inno@@ cent . 
i find that fascinating . 
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if one cra@@ she@@ s for nine planes taking off . 
but somehow we manage to un@@ sub@@ scri@@ be from this problem . 
it is not our problem . 
it is not our bur@@ den . 
it is not our fight . 
i talk a lot about these questions . 
i talk about race and ask if we have the right to kill . 
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students %african-american history . i &apos;m talking about sla@@ very . 
i talk about terror@@ ism , the time towards the end of the re@@ construction , to the beginning of world war ii . 
we do not really know much about it . 
but for the african americans in this country it was a time of terr@@ or . 
in many areas people had to be afraid of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs@@ , 
or before bom@@ bs . 
it was the fear of terr@@ or that sha@@ ped her life . 
these older people come to me and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , they talk , they give lec@@ tures . they tell people to stop saying that for the first time in the history of our nation , we are dealing with terrori@@ sm@@ : after 9 / 11 . &quot; 
they say , &quot; no - tell people that we grew up with it . &quot; 
and of course after ra@@ cis@@ m came ra@@ cial se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of ra@@ cially motiv@@ ated sub@@ ju@@ gation and ap@@ art@@ hei@@ d . 
and yet there is a dynamic in our country . . . we do not like to talk about our problems . 
we do not like to talk about our history . 
and therefore we do not really understand the meaning of our actions in the histor@@ ical context . 
we constantly colli@@ de . 
we are always creating new ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts . 
it &apos;s hard for us to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation . 
in south africa , people have understood that ra@@ cial se@@ gre@@ gation can not be over@@ come without the will@@ ing@@ ness for truth and re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation . 
even after the geno@@ cide in r@@ wand@@ a , there was this will@@ ing@@ ness , but not in this our country . 
i have held several lec@@ tures in germany on the death pen@@ alt@@ y . 
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists got up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply dist@@ ur@@ bing to hear you talk like that . &quot; 
he sa@@ i@@ d@@ : &quot; there is no death pen@@ alt@@ y in germany . 
and of course there can never be any more in germany . &quot; 
it became very quie@@ t . then a woman sa@@ i@@ d@@ : &quot; our history makes it impossible for us to ever again speak out for the syste@@ matic killing of people . 
it would be consci@@ en@@ cele@@ ss of us to deli@@ ber@@ ately and pur@@ pos@@ efully ex@@ ecu@@ te people . &quot; 
i was thinking about it . 
how it would feel to live in a world where the ger@@ man state ex@@ ecu@@ ted people , especially if there were %disproportionately many je@@ ws among them . 
it would be unbe@@ arab@@ le . 
it would be uns@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous . 
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we jud@@ ge people - here is the risk of being sent@@ enced to death ele@@ ven times higher if the vic@@ tim is white than if it is black . tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ two times higher , when the defen@@ dan@@ t is black and knows the vic@@ tim - in the same states where the bodies of the let@@ har@@ gic people rest in their earth . 
and yet there is this mental dis@@ connection . 
i think our identity is thre@@ ate@@ ned . 
if we do not deal with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are also affected . 
we love innovation . 
we love technology and creativity . 
we love enter@@ tainment . 
but in the end , these reali@@ ties are over@@ sha@@ dow@@ ed by suffering , ab@@ use , dis@@ para@@ gement , exc@@ lu@@ sion . 
it seems important to me to combin@@ e both . 
because we are talking about the fact that we need more hope , more commit@@ ment , more de@@ vo@@ tion to survive in a complex world . 
for me that means spending time , thinking and talking about the poor , the dis@@ advan@@ tag@@ ed , the ones who will never be at ted . 
but think in a way that is integr@@ ated into our own lives . 
we all must ultimately believe things that we can not see . 
we do that . as rational as we are , as much as we intellec@@ tu@@ ally value . 
innovation , creativity , and development do not just come from our minds . 
they come from ideas that are driven by the con@@ vic@@ tion in our he@@ arts . 
it is this heart and sou@@ l connection that i believe dri@@ ves us not only to be open to all the bright and exciting things , but also to the dark and proble@@ matic ones . 
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ ch politi@@ cian , once sa@@ i@@ d@@ : 
&quot; when we were fighting against opp@@ res@@ sion in eastern europe , we wanted everything possible . but what we needed most was hope , a spiritu@@ al ori@@ entation , the will@@ ing@@ ness to be in des@@ per@@ ate places , and wit@@ ness . &quot; 
this mental ori@@ entation is at the core of what i believe the ted communities must be commit@@ ted to . 
there is no dem@@ arc@@ ation of technology and design that allows us to be who@@ ll@@ y human unless we have eyes and ear@@ s for poverty , exc@@ lu@@ sion and in@@ justice . 
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity dem@@ ands a lot more from us than we did not care about it . 
she will touch her deeply . 
as a young law@@ yer , i had the great privi@@ lege of meeting pin@@ k par@@ k@@ s@@ , 
ms . par@@ ks always came back to mon@@ t@@ go@@ mer@@ y , where she met two of her ol@@ dest friends . these older women , john@@ nie car@@ r , who had organized the mon@@ t@@ go@@ mer@@ y bus bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt - an incredible african american - and virg@@ ini@@ a dur@@ r , a white , whose husband , cli@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ r , d@@ r . king repres@@ ented . 
so these women met and talked easily . 
from time to time , mr@@ s . car@@ r called me and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , frau park is coming to town . we want to talk . 
do you want to come and listen@@ ? &quot; 
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot; 
she said , &quot; and what will they do when they are her@@ e@@ ? &quot; 
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot; 
and i went over and just listen@@ ed . 
it has always been so inspi@@ ring , so inspi@@ ring . 
one day i sat there and listen@@ ed to these women , and after a few hours , ms . par@@ ks turned to me and said , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me what the %&apos;initiative for equal right &apos; is . 
what are you trying to achie@@ ve@@ ? &quot; 
i started with my usual lec@@ ture . 
i said , &quot; we try to act against in@@ justice . 
we want to help people who have been con@@ vic@@ ted of inno@@ cen@@ ce . 
we want to com@@ bat bi@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the pen@@ al system . 
we want to abo@@ li@@ sh life imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ment without condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment for children . 
we want to do something about the death pen@@ alt@@ y . 
we want to reduce the number of in@@ mates . 
we want to do away with mass imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ment . &quot; 
i gave my usual lec@@ ture , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; um@@ m . m@@ hm@@ m . m@@ hm@@ m . &quot; 
she said , &quot; that will make her very , very ti@@ red . &quot; 
then she lea@@ ned over to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very bra@@ ve . &quot; 
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be bra@@ ver . 
we have to find ways . to face up to these challen@@ ges@@ : these problems , this suffering . 
because ultimately our humanity depen@@ ds on our humanity . 
i learned very simple things in my work . 
i learned a few simple things . 
that we are all more than the worst we have ever done . 
i think that appli@@ es to every human being on the planet . 
if someone is lying , he is not just a li@@ ar . 
if someone takes something that does not bel@@ ong to him , he is not just a thi@@ e@@ f . 
even someone who kill@@ s someone is not just a mur@@ derer . 
and because that is so , there is a fundamental human dig@@ nity that must respect the law . 
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth . 
i do not believe that . 
i believe that in too many places the opposite of poverty is justice . 
and finally , i believe that , although it is so dra@@ matic , so beautiful and inspi@@ ring , and so inspi@@ ring , in the end we are not measu@@ red by our technology , not by the things we develop , not in our intellec@@ t and understanding . 
in the end , a society is not jud@@ ged by how it treat@@ s its rich and powerful and privi@@ leg@@ ed , but by how it dea@@ ls with the poor , the con@@ vic@@ ted , the imp@@ ris@@ oned . 
because in this context , we begin to understand the truly amazing things that make us different . 
sometimes i lose the balance . a story at the end . 
sometimes i push too much . 
i get ti@@ red , like all of us . 
sometimes these ideas pre@@ ce@@ de our thinking , in a very important way . 
i represent these children , who were sent@@ enced to very sever@@ e pun@@ ish@@ ment . 
i go to the det@@ enti@@ on center and visit a cli@@ ent who may be 13 or 14 years old and who should stand trial as an adult . 
then i wonder@@ : how could that happen@@ ? 
how can a jud@@ ge turn someone into something he is not@@ ? 
the jud@@ ge reg@@ ards him as an adult , but i see a child . 
one night , i sta@@ yed up too long and thought , go@@ sh , if a jud@@ ge can turn us into something else , then he must have mag@@ ical power@@ s . 
yes , br@@ y@@ an , the jud@@ ge has mag@@ ical power@@ s . 
you should also wish you some . 
and because it was late , and i could not think proper@@ ly , i started working on a pro@@ pos@@ al . 
i had a 14@@ -year-old , poor black boy as a cli@@ ent . 
and i started with this requ@@ est . the head@@ line read@@ : &quot; requ@@ est to treat my poor , 14@@ -year-old black cli@@ ent as a privi@@ leg@@ ed , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old top mana@@ ger . &quot; 
in my appli@@ cation , i stat@@ ed that mis@@ conduc@@ t by the public pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tor &apos;s office and the police as well as proce@@ dur@@ al er@@ ro@@ rs had to be taken into account . 
there was a crazy line about the fact that in this country nothing is right , that there is only mis@@ conduc@@ t . 
the next morning i wo@@ ke up and did not remember if i had just dre@@ amed this crazy requ@@ est or actually written it . 
and to my hor@@ ror i had not only written it , but also sent it to the cour@@ t . 
a few months passed and i had just for@@ gotten everything . 
but finally i decided , god , i have to go to the cour@@ t and tell this crazy case . 
i got into the car and was really over@@ whe@@ l@@ med - over@@ whe@@ l@@ med . 
so i dro@@ ve to the cour@@ t . 
and i thought it would be so hard , so pain@@ ful . 
finally , i got out of my car and went up the sta@@ irs to the cour@@ t . 
as i went up the sta@@ irs to the cour@@ t . there was an older , black man , the jan@@ it@@ or in the cour@@ t . 
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are the@@ y@@ ? &quot; 
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he sa@@ i@@ d@@ ,@@ &quot; are you a law@@ ye@@ r@@ ? &quot; i said yes . &quot; 
he came to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me . 
then he whi@@ sper@@ ed in my ear . 
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot; 
and i have to say , it gave me strength . 
it tou@@ ched something deep inside me , identity , the ability of each individual to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective of hope . 
well , i enter@@ ed the cour@@ tro@@ om . 
as soon as the jud@@ ge saw me@@ , 
he said , &quot; m@@ r . ste@@ ven@@ son , have you made this crazy requ@@ est@@ ? &quot; 
i said yes . and then we started to discus@@ s . 
more and more people came in just because they were ang@@ ry 
that i had written these crazy things . 
police offi@@ cers came in and dep@@ u@@ ty pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors and office workers . 
in no time at all , the cour@@ tro@@ om was full of people ang@@ ry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about ine@@ quality . 
from my corner of my eye , i saw the care@@ ta@@ ker pac@@ ing up and down . 
he kept looking through the window and could hear the whole to@@ hu@@ wa@@ bo@@ h@@ u . 
he went up and down . 
finally , this el@@ der@@ ly black man came into the cour@@ tro@@ om with a very worried face print and sat directly behind me , almost on the defen@@ se ben@@ ch . 
ten minutes later , the jud@@ ge announ@@ ced a break . 
during the break , a police offi@@ cer came in , bot@@ her@@ ing that the jan@@ it@@ or was in the cour@@ tro@@ om . 
that dep@@ u@@ ty ran over to the older black one . 
he said , &quot; ji@@ mm@@ y , what are you doing in the cour@@ tro@@ om@@ ? &quot; 
the older black man got up . he looked at the dep@@ u@@ ty , then looked at me , and he said , &quot; i came here to tell this young man , do not lose sight of the goal . do not give up . &quot; 
i came to ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pen@@ dul@@ um of the universe is far off , but that it ten@@ ds to justice . 
that as humans we are not fully developed unless we care about human rights and values . 
that all our survival is lin@@ ked to the survival of each individual . 
that we must combin@@ e our vision of technology and design , of enter@@ tainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice . 
and above all , i just want to say to those of you who see it that wa@@ y@@ : do not lose sight of the goal . do not give up . 
they have seen and heard an obvious desire from this audience , this community , to help them and to do something . 
what else can we do ? 
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son@@ : well , there are possibilities everywhere . 
if you live in california , there is a refer@@ end@@ um this spring , which is really about making an effort to diver@@ t some of the cas@@ h flow that otherwise flo@@ ws into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment . 
here , in california , for example , one billion dollars will be spent on the death pen@@ alt@@ y over the next five years . a billion dollars . 
and yet , 4@@ 6@@ % of all hom@@ ic@@ ide@@ s do not end in ar@@ rest . 
5@@ 6@@ % of all cases of ra@@ pe do not come before the cour@@ t . 
there is a chance to do something here . 
this refer@@ end@@ um will suggest invest@@ ing the money in more security and security . 
i think there are possibilities everywhere . 
for the past three decades , the crime rate in america has fallen dra@@ matically . 
this fact is often lin@@ ked to the increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation numbers . 
what would you say to someone who belie@@ ves th@@ at@@ ? 
well , in fact , the number of violent cri@@ mes has not changed much . 
most of the mass imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ment in this country did not really take place in the class of violent cri@@ mes . 
it was the mis@@ gui@@ ded cru@@ sa@@ de against drugs . 
therefore , the dra@@ matic high pay of the pris@@ one@@ rs . 
we were car@@ ried away by the rhe@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment . 
now we have &quot; %three-offense&quot; laws that put people behind bar@@ s forever , bi@@ ke the@@ ft , min@@ or the@@ ft , instead of for@@ cing them to return things to the vic@@ ti@@ ms . 
i think we have to do more to help people who have become vic@@ ti@@ ms of crime , not less . 
and i believe our current pun@@ ish@@ ment philosoph@@ y will not help anyone . 
i think that &apos;s what we have to change . 
br@@ y@@ an , you really made a string s@@ wing here . 
you are an inspi@@ rational person@@ ality . 
thanks for being with ted . many thanks . 
spo@@ ke@@ sm@@ an@@ : bin laden &apos;s death ent@@ ai@@ ls an increas@@ ed risk of dan@@ ger . 
spo@@ ke@@ sm@@ an 2@@ : fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . spo@@ ke@@ sm@@ an 3@@ : pe@@ pp@@ er spra@@ y of the police . 
spo@@ ke@@ sm@@ an 4@@ : evil car@@ tel@@ s . spo@@ ke@@ sm@@ an 5@@ : dangerous cru@@ ise ships . 
spo@@ ke@@ sm@@ an 6@@ : social dec@@ line . spo@@ ke@@ sm@@ an 7@@ : 65 dead . 
spo@@ ke@@ sm@@ an 8@@ : tsun@@ ami war@@ ning . spo@@ ke@@ sm@@ an 9@@ : cyber@@ -@@ attac@@ ks 
different speak@@ er@@ s@@ : drug war . mass destruction weapons . tor@@ na@@ do . 
rec@@ ession . stand@@ still . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ yp@@ t . sy@@ ri@@ a . 
crisis . death . cat@@ astrop@@ he . 
oh my god . 
so these are just a few of the cli@@ ps i &apos;ve colle@@ cted over the past six months - but it could also have been the last six days . or the last six years . 
the fact is that the media pre@@ fer to show us negative issues because our minds pay close attention to these issues . 
and there is a very good reason for that . 
every second every day our sen@@ ses capture much more information than our brain can ever hand@@ le . 
and because nothing is more important to us than our survival , the first stop for all the information is part of our tempor@@ al lo@@ be , the am@@ y@@ g@@ da@@ la . 
the am@@ y@@ g@@ da@@ la is our early war@@ ning system , our dan@@ ger dete@@ ctor . 
it sorts and sc@@ ours all the information in search of any indi@@ cation of dan@@ ger in our environment . 
so when we see the news , we pre@@ fer to look for negative news . 
and the old ada@@ ge , &quot; if it ble@@ ed@@ s , demand increas@@ es &quot; is very true . 
now , with all of our digital devices deli@@ vering all of this negative news 24 hours a day , seven days a week , it &apos;s no wonder we &apos;re pe@@ ssi@@ mis@@ tic . 
it is no wonder that everyone thinks that the world is getting worse and worse . 
but maybe this is not the case . 
maybe that &apos;s the reality . 
perhaps the tremendous progress that we have made in the last century through a series of forces will acceler@@ ate so much that in the next three decades we will be able to create a world of ab@@ und@@ ance . 
well , i &apos;m not saying that we do not have big problems - climate crisis , species extin@@ ction , water and energy problems - we already have them . 
and as humans , we are much better at anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing problems in the very long term , but ultimately over@@ coming them . 
let &apos;s take a look at what we have achie@@ ved in the last century so that we can anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ e the development . 
average life expec@@ tan@@ cy has more than dou@@ bled in the last 100 years , and the average world population &apos;s %inflation-adjusted average income has tri@@ ple@@ d . 
child mortality has dec@@ reas@@ ed by one tent@@ h . 
in addition , food , electricity , transpor@@ tation and communication costs have dec@@ reas@@ ed many times over . 
steve pin@@ ker showed us that we are currently living in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history . 
and according to charles kenn@@ y , the liter@@ acy rate has ris@@ en from 25@@ % to 8@@ 0@@ % in the past 13@@ 0 years . 
we live in a really extraordinary time . 
and many people forget this . 
and we are constantly raising our expec@@ tations . 
in fact , we have re@@ defined poverty . 
keep in mind that a large propor@@ tion of americans living below the poverty line have access to electricity , water , toile@@ ts , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , telev@@ isi@@ ons , cell phones , air condi@@ tion@@ ers and cars . 
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists of the last century , the imp@@ er@@ ators of the earth , could never have dre@@ amed such lux@@ ur@@ ies . 
much of it is based on technologies , and these are growing exponenti@@ ally . 
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil has shown us that every tool that becomes information technology makes big lea@@ ps on the mo@@ ore@@ s law , and the %price-performance-quotient dou@@ bles every 12 to 24 months . 
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your po@@ cket costs around one million times less and is a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer from the 197@@ 0s . 
now look at this cur@@ ve . 
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law of the last hundred years . 
note two things about this cur@@ ve . 
first , how smo@@ ot@@ hl@@ y it run@@ s - in good times and in bad times , war or peace , rec@@ ession , depression and boo@@ m . 
that &apos;s the result of faster computers building faster computers . 
it does not slow down for any of our big problems . 
in addition , despite its log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic course on the left , it run@@ s up@@ hill . 
the growth rate itself is th@@ us acceler@@ ating . 
and on this turn , on the back of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we find a number of exc@@ ep@@ tional technologies available to all . 
&quot; cloud computing &quot; something my friends at auto@@ des@@ k &quot; %infinite-computing &quot; call , sensor@@ s and networks , robots , 3d prin@@ ters that make it possible to democra@@ ti@@ ze personal production on our planet , syn@@ thetic biology , fu@@ els , vac@@ cin@@ es and food , digital medicine , nan@@ o-@@ materials and artificial intelligence . 
how many of them have won the ib@@ ms super@@ computer wat@@ son at &quot; risk &quot; seen ? 
that was terri@@ fic . 
i sc@@ our@@ ed the new@@ spa@@ pers and sear@@ ched for the best head@@ lines i could find . 
i love thes@@ e@@ : &quot; wat@@ son de@@ fe@@ ats human ad@@ ver@@ sar@@ y . &quot; 
&quot; risk &quot; is not an easy game . 
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ ance@@ s of the language . 
imagine that this artificial intelligence would be available to every ow@@ ner of a mobile phone . 
four years ago ray kurz@@ weil and i started here at ted a new university , the &quot; sing@@ ul@@ ari@@ ty university &quot; called . 
we teach our students all these technologies , with a special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity . 
and every year , we ask students to create companies , products and services that can posi@@ tively influence the lives of billions of people within a decade . 
think about how a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people . 
30 years ago , this would have so@@ unded ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous . 
today we can point to do@@ zens of companies that have done just that . 
when i think of abo@@ unding , i do not mean a life of lux@@ ury for anyone on this planet@@ ; i want to create a life full of possibilities . 
it &apos;s about making ab@@ und@@ ance of sc@@ arc@@ e goods . 
sc@@ arc@@ ity is con@@ text@@ ual , and technology is a %resource-liberating force . 
here is an example . 
this is the story of nap@@ ol@@ e@@ on i@@ ii . in the middle of the 18@@ th century . 
he is the guy on the left . 
he has invited the king of si@@ am for supp@@ er . 
nap@@ ol@@ e@@ on &apos;s soldiers got sil@@ ver cu@@ t@@ ler@@ y , nap@@ ol@@ e@@ on himself got gold cu@@ t@@ ler@@ y . 
the king of si@@ am , however , got al@@ umin@@ um cu@@ t@@ ler@@ y . 
al@@ umin@@ um was the most valuable metal on the planet at that time , more valuable than gold and plat@@ in@@ um . 
this is why the dom@@ e of the washington mon@@ um@@ ent was made of al@@ umin@@ um . 
although al@@ umin@@ um occu@@ pie@@ s 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it does not appear to be pur@@ e metal . 
it is lin@@ ked by oxygen and sili@@ cat@@ es . 
but then the technology of electro@@ ly@@ sis was developed and made al@@ umin@@ um production so favor@@ able that we use it with our thro@@ wa@@ way ment@@ ality . 
then let us project this analog@@ y into the future . 
we think today of energy shor@@ tage . 
my ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet that is filled with 5,000 times more energy than we consum@@ e an@@ nu@@ ally . 
16 ter@@ aw@@ att energi@@ e pat@@ ter every 8@@ 8 minutes on the surface of the earth . 
it is not a shor@@ tage , the problem is acc@@ essi@@ bility . 
and there are good news . 
this year , for the first time , it has been possible to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the dies@@ el power - 8@@ .@@ 8 rup@@ ee@@ s compared to 17 rup@@ ee@@ s . 
the cost of solar energy fell by 50 percent last year . 
last month published this with a study showing that by the end of this decade solar energy in the sun@@ ny regi@@ ons of the usa will cost 6 cents per k@@ w@@ h , compared to 15 cents in the national average . 
and if we have a sur@@ plus of energy then we will also have pl@@ ent@@ y of water . 
let &apos;s talk about water wars . 
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan turned the vo@@ y@@ ager spac@@ ec@@ raft back to earth in 199@@ 0 , when it passed satur@@ n@@ ? 
he took a famous photo . what was it call@@ ed@@ ? 
&quot; a pal@@ e blue do@@ t . &quot; 
because we live on a water planet . 
we live on a planet 70 percent covered with water . 
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent sal@@ t water , 2 percent is ic@@ ed , and we &apos;re fighting for 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the planet &apos;s water , but there &apos;s hope here as well . 
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now . 
new %nanotechnologies are on the way , nan@@ o-@@ materials . 
and from a conversation this morning with dea@@ n kam@@ an , one of the innova@@ tors of do it yourself , i would like to share something with you - he gave me the per@@ mission - his techn@@ ol@@ g@@ y , the &quot; sl@@ ings@@ hot &quot; which many of you may already have heard of . it has the size of a fri@@ dge in the student resi@@ dence . 
it can produce a thousand liter@@ s of clean drin@@ king water per day from different sources - whether sal@@ t water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ rin@@ e - and all that for less than 2 cents per li@@ ter . 
the cha@@ ir@@ man of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just agre@@ ed to laun@@ ch a large test project with a hundred uni@@ ts in developing countries . 
and if all goes well , and i am very confi@@ dent , then co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will apply this technology glob@@ ally in 20@@ 6 countries all over the planet . 
this is %technology-supported innovation that exists today . 
and we have seen this on mobile phones as well . 
goo@@ dness , we &apos;ll soon reach the 70 percent co@@ verage rate of mobile phones in developing countries by the end of 20@@ 13 . 
just remember that a mas@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has better mobile communication than president re@@ aga@@ n 25 years ago . 
and if you search google with your smar@@ t@@ phone , you have more access to information and information than president clin@@ ton 15 years ago . 
you live in a world that has information and communication in ab@@ und@@ ance that no one else could ever have predi@@ cted . 
and , even better , the things she and i spent several thousand dollars on - gps , h@@ d video and photo , libr@@ aries full of books and music , medical diagno@@ stics technology - are literally becoming de@@ materi@@ alized and che@@ aper in her phone . 
and the best part of it may be what aw@@ ai@@ ts us in the area of ​​health . 
in the last month i had the pleasure , with the qua@@ l@@ com@@ m foundation the so-@@ called &quot; $ 10 million qua@@ l@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize &quot; to announ@@ ce . 
we challenge teams around the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device because it &apos;s equi@@ pped with ki , you can cou@@ gh up or test your blood coun@@ ts . 
and to win , the device needs to diagno@@ se better than a team of highly quali@@ fied doctors . 
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the bur@@ den of disease and 1.@@ 3 percent of health workers . 
when this device sequen@@ ces a r@@ na or dna virus that is not known , it calls the health auth@@ ority and pr@@ events a pan@@ dem@@ ic before it break@@ s out . 
but now to the greatest power that will lead us to a world of ab@@ und@@ ance . 
i call them &quot; the coming billion &quot; , 
the white lines represent population . 
we have just passed the 7 billion mark . 
and by the way , the biggest he@@ dge against a population explosion is better education and nutri@@ tion throughout the world . 
in 2010 , we had just under two billion people online connected . 
by 20@@ 20 , we expect to grow from two to five billion internet users . 
three billion new heads that we have never heard of before will join global communic@@ ations . 
what do these people need@@ ? 
what will you consum@@ e@@ ? what will you des@@ ir@@ e@@ ? 
and instead of economic sta@@ g@@ nation , i see one of the biggest economic b@@ out@@ s in history . 
these people represent several trilli@@ ons of dollars that will flow into the global economy . 
and they will become health@@ ier by using the tri@@ co@@ der , and they will be better educ@@ ated by the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by having the possibility of 3d prin@@ ting and &quot; infin@@ ite computing &quot; and be so much more productive than ever before . 
so what can 3 billion growing , healthy , educ@@ ated , productive members of the community bring to us@@ ? 
how about a set of new , never heard before voices . 
how about giving the opp@@ ressed , where@@ ver they are , a voice to attra@@ ct attention and create change , for the very first ti@@ me@@ ? 
what will these three billion people bring with them@@ ? 
how about post@@ s that we can not even predi@@ ct@@ ? 
one of the things i learned from the x prize is that small teams motiv@@ ated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that big companies and governments could only do in the past . 
i want to finish with a story that really got me excited . 
there is a program that some may already know . 
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit . 
it was developed at the university of washington in se@@ attle . 
and it &apos;s a game in which people can take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to explore how the protein will evol@@ ve . 
depen@@ ding on your behavior , we can predict the structure and function . 
and this is very important in medical research . 
so far this has been a problem for super@@ computers . 
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors and so on . 
and there are now hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online . 
and it showed that today human pattern recogni@@ tion fol@@ ds the proteins better than the best super@@ computers . 
and when these people came and saw who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , this was not a co-@@ professor , nor a cal@@ tech student , it was somebody from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who worked as an assi@@ stant to the management during the day re@@ ha clin@@ ic worked at night and was the best protein fol@@ der in the world . 
my ladies and gentle@@ men , what gives me tremendous confidence in our future is the fact that today we do more than have individuals to face the great challenges of our planet . 
we have access to tools with exponenti@@ al technology . 
we have the passion of a di@@ y innova@@ tor . 
we have the capital of the %techno-philanthropic . 
and we have three billion new heads that we can work with online to master the new challenges and to do what is needed . 
we expect a few extraordinary decades . 
thank you very much . 
i believe we need to do something about a changing piece of medical culture . 
and i think it starts with a doctor and that &apos;s me . 
and maybe i have been in the business long enough to allow myself to give up a piece of my own fal@@ se pre@@ stige to make this possible . 
but before i get to the top@@ ic of my speech , let &apos;s start with a little base@@ ball . 
hey , why not@@ ? 
we are close to the seas@@ on and we are head@@ ing for the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship . 
we all love base@@ ball , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
base@@ ball is full of great statistics . 
and there are hundreds of them . 
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball &quot; coming soon and revol@@ ving around statistics and to use them to set up a great base@@ ball team . 
i will re@@ fer to a statisti@@ c that i hope most of you have heard of before . 
it is the average power of the ra@@ cket . 
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat stri@@ kes 300 . 
this means that the player certainly hits 3 out of 10 hits . 
that means to hit the ball into the field , it comes up , it is not caught , and who tried to throw the ball to the first base did not make it in time and the run@@ ner was in safety . 
three out of 10 . 
do you know how to call a 30@@ 0@@ th in major lea@@ gue base@@ ball@@ ? 
good , really good , maybe an all@@ -@@ star . 
do you know how to call a 40@@ 0@@ ter@@ ? 
that is someone who is sure to hit 4 out of 10 . 
leg@@ end@@ ary - as ted willi@@ ams leg@@ end@@ ary - the last major lea@@ gue base@@ ball player to hit over 400 times during a regular seas@@ on . 
let us trans@@ fer you back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less comfortable after talking to them about it . 
suppose you have a pel@@ vi@@ c inf@@ lam@@ mati@@ on and you are refer@@ red to a surgeon whose average performance is 400 with reg@@ ard to cel@@ i@@ a@@ c inf@@ lam@@ mati@@ on . 
somehow it does not work , ri@@ ght@@ ? 
assu@@ ming you live in a certain remote area , you have a loved one with clo@@ g@@ ged cor@@ on@@ ary ves@@ sel@@ s , and your family doctor as@@ sign@@ s you to a car@@ di@@ ologist whose average performance in vas@@ cular imag@@ ing is 200 . 
but , but do you know what@@ ? 
she is much better this year . she is on the way up . 
and she hits a 25@@ 7 . 
somehow it does not work . 
but i will ask you a question . 
what do you think the average performance should be for a car@@ di@@ ologist or nur@@ se or or@@ tho@@ pe@@ dis@@ t , an obs@@ te@@ tri@@ cian , a res@@ cu@@ er@@ ? 
1,000 , very good . 
the truth is that nobody in medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant should be . 
what we do , however , is that we send each one of them , myself inclu@@ ded , to the world with the cla@@ im to be perfect . 
never make a mistake , but no one will worry about the details of how this should be done . 
and that &apos;s the message i took in my medical studies . 
i was a compu@@ l@@ si@@ vely obs@@ essi@@ ve student . 
in high school , a class@@ mate once said that brian gold@@ mann was studying for a blood test . 
and so it was . 
and i learned in my little par@@ lo@@ r in the sister resi@@ dence at tor@@ onto general hospital , not far from here . 
i learned everything by heart . 
in my lec@@ ture on an@@ atom@@ y i learned the origin@@ s and spu@@ rs of every muscle , every bran@@ ch of every art@@ ery , which leads away from the a@@ or@@ ta , obs@@ cure and ordinary differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ ses . 
i even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bul@@ ar aci@@ do@@ sis . 
and all the time i gather@@ ed more and more knowledge . 
and i was fine , i finished cu@@ m lau@@ de . 
and i left the study of medicine with the impres@@ sion that i , if i knew everything by heart and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to comple@@ ten@@ ess as possible that i was imm@@ une to making mista@@ kes . 
and it worked for a while , until i met a prin@@ ter . 
i resi@@ ded at a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto when a woman prin@@ ter was brought to me in the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital . 
at this time , i was as@@ sign@@ ed to the car@@ di@@ ological level in the car@@ di@@ ology service . 
and it was my as@@ sign@@ ment when the emergen@@ cy medical staf@@ f sou@@ ght car@@ di@@ a@@ c coun@@ sel@@ ing to exam@@ ine the emergen@@ cy patient . 
and give feedback to my sen@@ ior physi@@ cian . 
i was exam@@ ining women &apos;s prin@@ ters and she was in a brea@@ th@@ less condition . 
and as i listen@@ ed to her , she made pan@@ ting no@@ is@@ es . 
and when i che@@ cked her breast with the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear a cra@@ ck@@ ling sound on both sides , telling me that she was suffering from con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure . 
this is a condition in which the heart fail@@ s , instead of pump@@ ing all the blood , part of the blood gets stuck in the lun@@ gs and fil@@ ls them gradu@@ ally , so the shor@@ t@@ ness of breath came . 
and that was not a difficult diagno@@ sis . 
i turned it on and went to the treatment . 
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medicine to reli@@ ev@@ e pressure from my heart . 
i gave her medicine , which we call di@@ u@@ reti@@ cs , water tab@@ lets so that she elimin@@ ated the liquid . 
and over a period of one and a half to two hours , she began to feel better . 
i felt really good . 
and there i made my first mista@@ ke@@ ; i sent her home . 
i actually made two mista@@ kes . 
i sent her home without talking to my sen@@ ior physi@@ cian . 
i did not pick up the phone and did what i should have , what a call to my sen@@ ior physi@@ cian would have been to cla@@ ri@@ fy it with him , so that he would have had a chance to make his own image . 
and he knew her , he would have been able to contribu@@ te addi@@ tional information to her . 
maybe i did it with good reason . 
maybe i did not want to be the need@@ y doctor . 
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i ac@@ ted that way i would be able to care for my patients without having to contact him . 
my second mistake was worse . 
by sending her home i dis@@ reg@@ ar@@ ded a soft voice within me , trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , not a good idea , do not do that . &quot; 
in fact , i was so la@@ cking in self-@@ confidence that i asked the nur@@ se who was looking after a woman prin@@ ter , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay to go home@@ ? &quot; 
and the nur@@ se thought about it and said in a fac@@ tual way , &quot; of course , i think she &apos;ll be fine . &quot; 
i remember it as it was yesterday . 
so i sign@@ ed the dis@@ charge pa@@ pers and an am@@ bul@@ ance and am@@ bul@@ ance assi@@ stan@@ ts came and took them home . 
and i went back to work . 
the rest of the day , the ev@@ ening i had this na@@ g@@ ging feeling in my stom@@ ach . 
but i kept working . 
and at the end of the day i pac@@ ked my things , left the hospital and went to the car park to drive home when i was doing something i would not otherwise do . 
i went home through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home . 
and there said another nur@@ se , not the sister who had looked for woman prin@@ ter , but another three words to me and these three words fear most of the emergen@@ cy doctors that i know . 
other doctors also fear it , but emergen@@ cy medicine is very special because we only see the patients so fle@@ et@@ ingly . 
the three words are@@ : do you reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ? 
&quot; do you remember the patient you sent home@@ ? &quot; 
the nur@@ se asked %matter-of-factly . 
&quot; so she is back , &quot; she said in that particular ton@@ e . 
so she was back . 
she was back and dying . 
about an hour after she arrived home , after i sent her home , she collap@@ sed and the family called 9@@ 11 . the res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stan@@ ts took them back to the emergen@@ cy department with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous state of sho@@ ck . 
she bar@@ ely brea@@ the@@ d and blu@@ shed . 
the emergen@@ cy person@@ nel pulled all stran@@ ds . 
they gave her an increase in blood pressure . 
they connected them to the venti@@ lat@@ or . 
i was sho@@ cked and sha@@ tter@@ ed to the core . 
and i went through this roll@@ er co@@ aster because she came to the intensi@@ ve care station after stabili@@ zation and i hop@@ ed that she would rec@@ over . 
and after two or three days , it became clear that she would never wake up again . 
she had suff@@ ered an un@@ treat@@ able brain damage . 
her family gather@@ ed . 
and over the next eight or nine days , they sur@@ ren@@ dered to what had happened . 
on the other day they let you go - woman prin@@ ter , a woman , a mother and grandmother . 
it is said that one never for@@ gets the names of those dying . 
and that was the first time i experienced this myself . 
i bla@@ med myself for the next few weeks and for the first time myself experienced the un@@ healthy sha@@ me that exists in our medical culture - i felt alone , isol@@ ated , not the kind of healthy sha@@ me you feel because you &apos;re not with your colleagues can talk about it . 
you all know the healthy sha@@ me , if you reve@@ al a secret of the best friend , although this s@@ wor@@ e a secre@@ cy and then you get caught and the best friend con@@ fron@@ ted with it and my a terrible discussion leads , if one at the end of the bad consci@@ ence leads and one swe@@ ars that one never makes such a mistake again . 
if you make repar@@ ation and never make the mistake again . 
that &apos;s the kind of edu@@ cational sha@@ me . 
the un@@ healthy type i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you sick in the very core . 
it is the one who tells you that not what you did is bad , but that you are bad yourself . 
and that was what i felt . 
and it was not because of my sen@@ ior physi@@ cian , he was very nice . 
he talked to the family and i &apos;m sure he smo@@ othe@@ d the waves and made sure i was not su@@ ing . 
but from now on i asked myself these questions . 
why did not i ask the sen@@ ior physi@@ ci@@ an@@ ? why did i send you home@@ ? 
and then in my worst moment@@ s@@ : how could i make such a stupid mista@@ ke@@ ? 
why did i go to medic@@ ine@@ ? 
slowly but sur@@ ely it sett@@ led down . 
i started to feel better . 
and then on a clou@@ dy day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds and the sun broke out and i said maybe i can feel better again . 
and i figured out that if i dou@@ bled my ef@@ fort@@ s to perfe@@ ction and never made another mistake , the voice could fall sil@@ ent . 
and she did it . 
and i kept working . 
and then it happened again . 
two years later , i was on du@@ ty at the emergen@@ cy ward in a mu@@ ni@@ ci@@ pa@@ l hospital north of tor@@ onto , and i exam@@ ined a 25@@ -year-old man with an ir@@ ri@@ tat@@ ed thro@@ at . 
there was a lot going on and i was in a hur@@ ry . 
he always poin@@ ted here . 
i looked in the thro@@ at and it was a little bit pin@@ k . 
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and sent him away . 
and even as he walked out the door , he poin@@ ted at his thro@@ at . 
two days later , i came to my next emergen@@ cy service and my chi@@ e@@ f physi@@ cian asked me for a conversation in her office . 
and she said the three wor@@ d@@ s@@ : reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ? 
&quot; do you remember the patient with the ir@@ ri@@ tat@@ ed thro@@ at@@ ? &quot; 
it turned out he had a stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ cal infe@@ ction . 
he had a poten@@ tially life thre@@ ate@@ ning condition called epi@@ glo@@ tt@@ it@@ is . 
you can goog@@ ling it , but it is not an infe@@ ction of the phar@@ yn@@ x but the upp@@ er res@@ pir@@ atory tra@@ ct and causes the ob@@ struc@@ tion of the res@@ pir@@ atory tra@@ ct . 
and lu@@ ck@@ ily he did not die . 
he got in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous antibio@@ tics and re@@ covered a few days later . 
and i went through the same tor@@ ture of sha@@ me and self-@@ dou@@ bt again , feeling liber@@ ated and went back to work until it happened again and again and again . 
in an emergen@@ cy situation , i have twice over@@ looked a pel@@ vi@@ c inf@@ lam@@ mati@@ on . 
there is a lot to it , especially when you consider that you work in a hospital that had only 14 patients per night at that time . 
in both cases , i did not send her home and there were probably no shor@@ t@@ com@@ ings in her treatment . 
at one i thought he had ki@@ dney sto@@ nes . 
i ord@@ ered the x-@@ ray of the ki@@ dn@@ e@@ ys . when this was not done , my collea@@ gue , on re-@@ imag@@ ining the patient , found hard@@ ening in the lower right sector and called the surge@@ ons . 
the other one had sever@@ e di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a . 
i ar@@ ran@@ ged flu@@ id to re@@ hy@@ dra@@ te him and asked my colleagues to in@@ spec@@ t him as well . 
and he did that and when he noticed a hard@@ ening in the lower right sector , he called the oper@@ ate@@ ure . 
both were oper@@ ated on and were fine . 
both cases g@@ na@@ wed at me , ate me up . 
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mista@@ kes happened only in the first five years , which many of my colleagues cla@@ im but is total non@@ sense . 
some of my drin@@ ks have happened in the last five years . 
alone , ash@@ amed and without support . 
here &apos;s the proble@@ m@@ : if i can not finish with my mista@@ kes and talk about them , if i &apos;m the soft voice who tells me what really happened can not find , how can i share it with my collea@@ gu@@ es@@ ? 
how can i teach them my mista@@ kes so that they do not comm@@ it them@@ ? 
if i go into a room - like right now , then i have no idea what you think about me . 
when did you last hear from someone who spoke of a failure about a failure about a fail@@ ur@@ e@@ ? 
oh yes , you go to a cock@@ tail party and you may hear about some other doctor , but you will not hear someone talk about your own mista@@ kes . 
if i went into a room full of colleagues and asked for their immedi@@ ate support and started to tell them what i just told them , i would most likely not reach the end of the second story before it really gets un@@ pleas@@ ant , anyone would make a jo@@ ke , they would change the subject and forget the rest . 
and in fact , if i or my colleagues knew that an or@@ tho@@ pe@@ dis@@ t in my hospital had taken the wrong leg from someone , then they believe that i have problems looking him in the eye . 
that &apos;s the system we live in . 
it is a total den@@ ial of mista@@ kes . 
it is a system in which there are two basic posi@@ tions - those who make mista@@ kes and those who do not . those who restri@@ ct sleep loss and those without restri@@ ction , those with poor results and those with good results . 
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological reaction as are anti@@ bodies that attack a human being . 
and there is the idea that if we ban@@ ish those who make mista@@ kes from the medicine , that will leave us with a se@@ cure system . 
but there are two problems with it . 
in my appro@@ xi@@ mat@@ ely 20 years of medical broad@@ cas@@ ting and journ@@ alism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study on medical er@@ ro@@ rs and mis@@ treatment so i &apos;m looking forward to one of my first artic@@ les i star@@ red for the tor@@ onto show &quot; art &quot; , wrote , to learn . 
and what i learned is that mista@@ kes are absolutely essential . 
we work in a system where mista@@ kes happen every day , in which one out of every 10 medic@@ ations is either wrong or wr@@ on@@ gl@@ y do@@ sed , in which hospital infe@@ ctions become more and more num@@ ero@@ us and cause de@@ vas@@ tation or death . 
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous mista@@ kes . 
in the united states , the institute of medicine esti@@ mates the number at 100,000 . 
both are strong under@@ stat@@ ements because we do not look at the problem as well as we should . 
and is the cru@@ x . 
in a hospital system where medical knowledge dou@@ bles every two to three years , we can not compe@@ te . 
lack of sleep is om@@ ni@@ present . 
we can not get rid of him . 
we have a cognitive er@@ ror so we can take a perfect course of disease for a patient with a che@@ st pain . 
then i take the same patient with che@@ st pain , make him swe@@ at@@ y and tal@@ ka@@ tive and add a slightly in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ated breath and suddenly the story is inter@@ sper@@ sed with cont@@ emp@@ t . 
i do not take the same course . 
i am not a robo@@ t@@ ; i do not always do things the same way . 
and my patients are not car@@ s@@ ; they do not always tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way . 
all this together , mista@@ kes are inevi@@ table . 
so if you take the system the way i was taught it and sort out all the fau@@ l@@ ty health experts , there will not be any left at the end . 
and do you know the ly@@ re about people who do not want to talk about their worst cas@@ es@@ ? 
in my broad@@ cast &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot; i have the hab@@ it of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; i would say to everyone from the res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant to the car@@ di@@ ologist &apos;s chi@@ e@@ f physi@@ cian , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about her@@ ? &quot; and then i show him the micro@@ phone . 
and then their pu@@ pil@@ s expan@@ d , they are stun@@ ned , then they look down and swa@@ l@@ low hard , and begin to tell their stories . 
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories . 
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , do not make the same mista@@ kes that i made . &quot; 
what you need is an environment that you can put into it . 
what you need is a new medical culture . 
and it starts with a doctor . 
the new@@ ly defined doctor is a human being , knows about his humanity , accep@@ ts it , is not proud to make mista@@ kes , but he does everything to learn something from them , so that it can be passed on . 
she shares her experiences with others . 
it helps when others talk about their mista@@ kes . 
and it shows others their mista@@ kes , not to ex@@ pose them but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everyone benefits . 
and she works in a medical culture that recogni@@ zes that people fill the system with life , and if so , then people also make mista@@ kes from time to time . 
so that the system develop@@ s to create back@@ up@@ s that make it easier to track down er@@ ro@@ rs that make people inevi@@ table , and it also allows lo@@ ving to create suppor@@ tive spaces in which anyone who obser@@ ves healthcare can actually address things that are potential represent mista@@ kes and even be re@@ war@@ ded . especially for people like me who make mista@@ kes and should be re@@ war@@ ded for stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ ening them . 
my name is brian gold@@ man . 
i am the new@@ ly defined doctor . 
i am a human . i make mista@@ kes . 
i am sorry , but i am trying best to learn from it , to pass it on to others . 
i do not know what they think about me , but i can live with that . 
let me close with three of my own wor@@ d@@ s@@ : i remember . 
i will talk about a tiny little idea . 
it is about chan@@ ge@@ able nor@@ m values . 
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories to use the time . 
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es . 
you know that he was here in 18@@ 35 . 
they may think he was hun@@ ting fin@@ ches , but that &apos;s not true . 
he actually colle@@ cted fish . 
he described one of them as very &quot; ordinary &quot; , 
it was a grou@@ per . 
until the 8@@ 0s , he was fis@@ hed in a big way . 
now he is on the red list of en@@ danger@@ ed species . 
we have heard this story many times from the gal@@ á@@ pag@@ os is@@ lands or from other places , it is not very special . 
ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , we still come to the gal@@ á@@ pag@@ os is@@ lands . 
we still think they are original . 
the pa@@ mp@@ hl@@ ets still describe them as un@@ tou@@ ched . 
what happened here ? 
the second story is inten@@ ded to illu@@ strate another concept , the vari@@ able wa@@ ist size . 
because i experienced it when i studied a la@@ goo@@ n in west africa in 197@@ 1 . 
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa later . 
i thought i could integr@@ ate myself . 
and i got a bad sun@@ burn and was convinced that i really was not from there . 
it was my first sun@@ burn . 
as you can see , the la@@ goo@@ n was lin@@ ed with pal@@ m trees and a few man@@ gro@@ ves . 
there were ci@@ ch@@ li@@ ds of about 20 centi@@ meters , black chin@@ -@@ ja@@ w bre@@ ed@@ ers , a sub@@ species of ci@@ ch@@ li@@ ds . 
the fis@@ hes of these ci@@ ch@@ li@@ ds were very productive and the fisch@@ er lived well and ear@@ ned well above average in ghana . 
when i re@@ turned there 27 years later , the fish had sh@@ run@@ k to half its size . 
fully grown , they measu@@ red five centi@@ meters . 
they had been gene@@ tically cru@@ shed . 
they were still fish . 
the people were still happy . 
and the fish was lucky enough to be there . 
so nothing has changed , and yet everything has changed . 
my third little story tells about my invol@@ vement in the introdu@@ ction of tra@@ w@@ ling in sou@@ the@@ ast asia . 
in the 7@@ 0s - more at the beginning of the 6@@ 0s - europe pro@@ mot@@ ed many development projects . 
fishing has meant fishing for 100,000 fish , industrial fishing for this rather ug@@ ly ship mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 . 
i went with it and we made ele@@ va@@ tions throughout the southern south china sea and especially in the la@@ ke of ja@@ va . 
we had no words for what we caught there . 
i now know that it was the bottom of the sea . 
90 percent of our catch was spon@@ ges , other animals connected to the ground . 
most of the fish , the small spo@@ ts there on the ru@@ b@@ ble , the hea@@ p of ru@@ b@@ ble , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish . 
essentially , the bottom of the sea came on dec@@ k and was thro@@ wn back . 
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast . 
a survey is conduc@@ ted within one year and then starts commercial fishing . 
the reason is changed . from - in this case - a hard ground or soft coral mu@@ dd@@ y mis@@ t is . 
this is a dead tur@@ tle . 
they were not e@@ aten , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead . 
once we caught one alive . 
she was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet . 
then they wanted to kill her because you could eat them well . 
in fact , this mountain of deb@@ ri@@ s is accu@@ mul@@ ated by fis@@ her@@ s each time they drive into areas where fishing has never taken place . 
but it is not docum@@ ented . 
we are changing the world , but we do not remember it . 
we ad@@ just our norm@@ s to the new level and do not rec@@ all what was there . 
if you gener@@ alize it , the following happens . 
on the y-@@ axis are a few good thin@@ gs@@ : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green of your country , the water supply . 
it changes with time . it &apos;s changing , because for people , their actions are natural . 
every generation consi@@ ders the images they take at the beginning of their conscious lives as standard and will der@@ i@@ ve everything from them . 
the difference is then percei@@ ved as loss . 
but you do not notice the previous los@@ ses . 
there can be a sequence of changes . 
and in the end they only want to get the wr@@ et@@ ched rema@@ ins . 
that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re ai@@ ming for . 
we want to get things that have disappe@@ ared or things that are not what they were . 
you might now think that the problem was affec@@ ting people who , when they lived in predat@@ ory societies , certainly killed animals and only became aware of what they had done after a few generations . 
because appar@@ ently , an animal that was very common , ra@@ rely , before it dies out . 
so you do not lose any common animals . 
you always lose rare animals . 
and therefore it is not percei@@ ved as a great loss . 
in time we focus on the big animals and in the sea these are the big fish . 
they become ra@@ re@@ r because we catch them . 
little fish is left over time and we think that &apos;s the nor@@ m . 
the question is why people accept this . 
well , because they do not know it was different . 
of course , many people , scientists , will confi@@ r@@ m that it was really different . 
they will confi@@ r@@ m it because the evidence , as they were in an earlier form , is not what they would like the evidence to show . 
there is , for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that the report of a cap@@ tain so-@@ and-@@ so , who obser@@ ved large numbers of fish in this area , can not be used , or is usually not sc@@ ore@@ d by fis@@ her@@ y scientists because he is not &quot; scientific &quot; is . 
so we have the situation that people do not know the past , even though we live in educ@@ ated societies because they do not trust the sources of the past . 
this shows the huge role a marine reser@@ ve can play . 
because through marine reser@@ ves , we basically rest@@ ore the past . 
we are rest@@ or@@ ing the past that people can not understand because the norm@@ s have changed and are very low . 
this will allow people who see a marine reser@@ ve to benefit from the insi@@ ght that en@@ ables them to res@@ et their norm@@ ative values . 
what about the people who can not do that because they do not have access - the people in the middle west for exam@@ ple@@ ? 
here , i think , the art and the film may fill the gap , as well as simul@@ ations . 
this is the simulation of che@@ sa@@ pe@@ ak@@ e bay . 
there were gra@@ y wh@@ ales there long ago - 500 years ago . 
and the sha@@ des and sha@@ des may remin@@ d you &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; , 
if you contact &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; thinking , if you remember why people were so tou@@ ched by it - apart from the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ ta@@ s story , why were you so tou@@ ched by the imag@@ er@@ y@@ ? 
because it ev@@ ok@@ es something that has in some ways been lost . 
so my re@@ comm@@ end@@ ation is that the only one i will give is to cam@@ ero@@ n to have &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under water turns . 
many thanks . 
in the 198@@ 0s , in commun@@ ist east germany , if you had a typ@@ e@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government . 
you also had to regi@@ ster a she@@ et with sam@@ ple text from this typ@@ e@@ writer . 
the reas@@ on@@ : the government could tra@@ ce back where a text came from . 
if you found an article with wrong ment@@ ality , you could track down the auth@@ or of these thoughts . 
and we in the west could not understand how anyone could do that , and how much that would lim@@ it the freedom of speech . 
in our own countries , we would never do that . 
but if you buy a new color las@@ er prin@@ ter from leading las@@ er prin@@ ter manufac@@ tur@@ ers in 20@@ 11 today and print a page , this page has bright yellow spo@@ ts prin@@ ted on each side , in a pattern that makes it easy to tra@@ ce the page back to you and your prin@@ ter . 
that happens to us today . 
and nobody seems to get up@@ set about that . 
and that was an example of how our own governments use technology against us , the citizens . 
and that &apos;s one of the three main sources of today &apos;s online issues . 
let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the world@@ : we can spli@@ t the attac@@ ks into categ@@ ories . 
we have three main groups . 
there are online crimin@@ als . 
for example , here is m@@ r di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from ki@@ e@@ v in u@@ kra@@ ine . 
and the motiv@@ es of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand . 
these people make money . 
they use online attac@@ ks to make a lot of money , a huge pil@@ e of money . 
there are several known cases of online milli@@ on@@ air@@ es , %multimillionaires , who have ear@@ ned their money through attac@@ ks . 
this is w@@ la@@ di@@ mir ts@@ ast@@ si@@ n from tar@@ tu in est@@ oni@@ a . 
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ za@@ le@@ z . 
ste@@ phen watt . 
b@@ j@@ ö@@ r@@ n sun@@ di@@ n . 
these are mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , tar@@ i@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so forth . 
these people have come to wealth online , but they have ac@@ qui@@ red it ill@@ eg@@ ally by tro@@ jan@@ s have used it to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do our online bank@@ ing , or even key@@ log@@ gers who have colle@@ cted our credit card information when in@@ putting via the key@@ board while sho@@ pping online through an infe@@ cted computer . 
two months ago , the us secret service fro@@ ze the swi@@ ss account of m@@ r sam ja@@ in here , and on this account was $ 14@@ .@@ 9 million when it was fro@@ zen . 
m@@ r . ja@@ in himself is on the loo@@ se , the place of resi@@ dence is un@@ known . 
and i cla@@ im that today we are more likely to become vic@@ ti@@ ms of online crime than a crime in the real world . 
and it is very obvious that this will only get worse . 
in the future , most cri@@ mes will play online . 
the second largest group of attac@@ kers we see today is not motiv@@ ated by money . 
they are motiv@@ ated by something else - prote@@ sts about , opini@@ on , or by their audience . 
groups like anony@@ mous have ris@@ en over the past 12 months and have become one of the main players in the field of online attac@@ ks . 
so these are the three main as@@ sau@@ lt grou@@ p@@ s@@ : crimin@@ als who do it for money , ha@@ ck@@ tivi@@ sts like anony@@ mous , who resi@@ st , but the last group are nations , governments that lead the attac@@ ks . 
there are cases like those of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar . 
it ex@@ emp@@ li@@ fi@@ es what happens when governments attack their own citizens . 
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate of att@@ or@@ ney from the net@@ her@@ lands - or was that . 
it had to fil@@ e for bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall , because dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar had been ha@@ cked . 
someone had broken in and had ha@@ cked the system tho@@ roughly . 
and last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government offi@@ ci@@ als , i asked one of the leaders of this group if he thought it possible that people had died as a result of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ ck . 
and his answer was &quot; yes &quot; , 
well , how do people die as a result of such a ha@@ ck@@ ? 
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fication body . 
you sell cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cat@@ es . 
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cat@@ es@@ ? 
well , a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate is needed if you have a website with ht@@ t@@ ps , with ss@@ l-@@ en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , for example g@@ mail . 
now we use all , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of your competi@@ tors . but these services are particularly pre@@ valent in tot@@ ali@@ tar@@ ian states such as iran , where dis@@ si@@ dent foreign provi@@ ders like g@@ mail use , because they know that they can trust them more than local provi@@ ders and that they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted via ss@@ l connections , so the local government does not can s@@ no@@ op around in their conver@@ sa@@ tions . 
but you can , if you are in a foreign 
cer@@ ti@@ fication auth@@ ority ha@@ cking and issu@@ ing fa@@ ke cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cat@@ es . 
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar . 
how about the arab spring and the things that happened in eg@@ yp@@ t@@ ? 
now , in ap@@ ri@@ l 20@@ 11 , insu@@ r@@ gent@@ s ra@@ ide@@ d the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an secret police . and they found a lot of fil@@ es . 
in these fil@@ es was a fol@@ der called &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her &quot; , 
and this fol@@ der con@@ tain@@ ed notes from a ger@@ man@@ -@@ based company that had sold a number of programs to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government to inter@@ cept any communic@@ ations from the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens on a very large scale . 
they had sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government . 
the company head@@ quar@@ ters is right here . 
so western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ ali@@ tar@@ ian governments with tools to deal with their own citizens . 
but western governments are also helping themselves . 
for example , in germany just a few weeks ago the so-@@ called state tro@@ ja@@ n horse found . this was a tro@@ ja@@ n used by ger@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to sp@@ y on their own citizens . 
if you are su@@ spec@@ ted in a crimin@@ al case , then almost certainly your phone will be ta@@ pped . 
but today we are far beyond that . 
they ta@@ p into their internet connection . 
they use things like the state tro@@ ja@@ n horse to popul@@ ate their computer with a tro@@ ja@@ n that allows them to monit@@ or all their communic@@ ations , listen to their online discus@@ sions , collect their pas@@ s@@ words . 
so if we keep thinking about such things , then the obvious answer from the people would be@@ : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it does not affect me , because i &apos;m a good citi@@ zen . 
i do not have to wor@@ r@@ y@@ ! 
i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; 
and this argument makes no sense . 
priv@@ acy must be given . 
priv@@ acy is not the debate . 
it is not a decision between priv@@ acy and security . 
it is a decision between freedom and control . 
and while we may trust our governments today in 20@@ 11 , every right we give is given away forever . 
and do we trust , blin@@ dly , to trust any future government , a government that we may have in fif@@ ty ye@@ ar@@ s@@ ? 
these are the questions we have to deal with for the next 50 years . 
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of conc@@ re@@ te blocks . 
the first conc@@ re@@ te blocks were made in 18@@ 6@@ 8 and came from a simple ide@@ a@@ : mod@@ ular mod@@ ul@@ es made of ce@@ ment that fit together . 
conc@@ re@@ te blocks quickly became the most wid@@ ely used building unit in the world . 
they en@@ ab@@ led us to build things larger than ourselves , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one stone at a time . 
essentially , the conc@@ re@@ te element had become the building block of our time . 
almost a hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , leg@@ o came out with it . 
it became the &quot; auto@@ matically connec@@ ting stone &quot; called . 
and within a few years , leg@@ o moved into every house@@ hold . 
it is esti@@ mat@@ ed that over 400 billion sto@@ nes were produced - or 75 sto@@ nes for each person on this planet . 
you do not have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful buildings . 
leg@@ o made it possible for everyone . 
leg@@ o essentially took the conc@@ re@@ te building block , the building block of the world , and turned it into a building block for our imagination . 
in the mean@@ time , the next revolution was announ@@ ced in the same year at bell lab@@ s , the next building block . 
the transi@@ sto@@ r was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of stati@@ c , stac@@ ked building blocks to a world where everything was inter@@ active . 
like the conc@@ re@@ te block , the transi@@ sto@@ r allows us to build much larger , more complex cy@@ cles , one stone at a time . 
but there is one main differ@@ en@@ ce@@ : the transi@@ sto@@ r was only for experts . 
i personally do not accept that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts and therefore i decided to change that . 
eight years ago i was at the media lab and i started to explore this idea of ​​how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers . 
a few years ago i started to develop li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its . 
let me show you how they work . 
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are electr@@ onic mod@@ ul@@ es that have a specific function . 
they are pre@@ fabri@@ cated to be light , sound , motor and sen@@ sor . 
and the best part is that they connect with magne@@ ts together . 
so you can not put them the wrong way around . 
the sto@@ nes are color co@@ ded . 
green is out@@ put , blue is current , pin@@ k is input and orange is cab@@ le . 
so all you have to do is connect one blue and one green and you can quickly build bigger circu@@ its . 
they add a blue to a green , and they can light up . 
you can inse@@ rt a switch in between and you have created a small di@@ mmer . 
take the switch out to inse@@ rt a pul@@ se mod@@ ul@@ e that is here , and you have made a small blin@@ ker . 
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for an extra effect and you have made a noise machine . 
i will stop that . 
beyond the simple play , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is actually quite powerful . 
instead of having to program , wire or sol@@ der , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its allows you to program them with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures . 
so to speed up or slow down the fla@@ sh@@ ing , simply turn this kno@@ b and it will make the pul@@ se faster or slow@@ er . 
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library . 
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a read@@ y-@@ made stone . 
lights , sounds , solar pan@@ els , motor@@ s - everything should be available . 
we distribu@@ ted li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to children and watched them play . 
and it was an incredible experience . 
the best part is how you begin to understand the electro@@ ni@@ cs that surro@@ und you in everyday life and that you do not learn at school . 
how , for example , a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why the do@@ ors of the ele@@ vat@@ or rema@@ in open , or how an ipo@@ d re@@ acts to contact . 
we also brought li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to design schools . 
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electr@@ onic things who started playing with li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its as a material . 
here we see , with felt , paper and water bot@@ tles , how geor@@ die . . . 
a few weeks ago we took li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to risk and gave them to some designers who had no technical experience - just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper - and told them@@ : &quot; do something . &quot; 
here is an example of a project you made , a %motion-controlled conf@@ et@@ ti can@@ no@@ n . 
but wait , this is really my favorite project . 
it is a lo@@ bs@@ ter made of dou@@ gh , which is afraid in the dark . 
for these non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its became another material , electro@@ ni@@ cs just became another material . 
and we want to make this material available to all . 
so li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is open source . 
you can go to the website , down@@ load all design temp@@ lat@@ es and make them yourself . 
we want to encourage the world of the crea@@ tor , the inven@@ tor , the contribu@@ tor , because the world in which we live , this inter@@ active world , is ours . 
so , move on and start inven@@ ting . 
many thanks .
