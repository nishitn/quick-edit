1139 T= and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intui@@ tive , increasingly natural , more user friend@@ ly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
1139 H= and there i just stop one of these little devices are high up , because things should increasingly become more intui@@ tively more increasingly more intui@@ tive , more natural user , us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly user , us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively or intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively more intui@@ tively .
1139 G= and there i hold up only one of these small devices , because things should become more and more intui@@ tive , more natural , more us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly and there you have to look , what is natural for us humans , what is us@@ er-@@ friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
1014 T= and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transpor@@ ts you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .

4119 T= now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensor@@ s colle@@ cting information from the car , trans@@ mit@@ ting this information into the system , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is colle@@ cted .
4119 H= now today , take you today , if you want a race , you need something like this -- something over@@ wash@@ ing the car in real tv , a few thousand brains who pass information information from the car , giving pass that information on the system , pass pass on the system and then then use it to send this car and share things in real time transition during information transition during information during real time .

5144 T= so a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o previ@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan .

4319 T= so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for temp@@ t to control a las@@ er and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be a@@ wes@@ ome . &quot;
4319 H= so i went home and ate her wife with my wife and obs@@ essed her of everything and we thought , &quot; now , second times when there can use these technologies that can use his eyes to control things , then we should need a path to control things , then we should need a path to drive things , so it can be able to make sure that it can be free again . &quot;
4319 G= so i went home and ate dinner with my wife and told her about everything and we thou@@ ght@@ : &quot; well , second , if there is this technology with which you can use your eyes to control things , then you should if we find a way that temp@@ t can control a las@@ er so that he can make gra@@ ff@@ iti again , that would be aw@@ es@@ ome . &quot;

2683 T= and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the nega@@ tives , which are essentially the radiation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .

909 T= and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from syn@@ thetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstra@@ ct code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like a computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s material , i mean real material , and not just cyber@@ ne@@ tic .
909 H= it &apos;s now just increasing biology in biology now , and this is where i want this metaphor that depen@@ ds coming from syn@@ thetic tic biology , take , that biology is actually is an informa@@ tional code , which is , which is an an more more abstra@@ ct of the computer , because it is matter because biology is matter because biology is matter because biology is matter because biology is matter because biology is matter because biology is matter , and isn &apos;t just cy@@ ber .

78 G= this made me a different person from my k@@ wa@@ ki@@ u@@ t@@ l friends , who believe that these fore@@ sts are the abo@@ de of hu@@ ku@@ k and the ben@@ t sky@@ -@@ be@@ ak and the can@@ ni@@ ba@@ l spir@@ its that live on the north end of the world , gh@@ ost@@ s that they have at their ham@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation would participa@@ te .
970 T= and they have there were two two tin@@ ker@@ ers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easier and che@@ aper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so fre@@ ely available hard@@ ware and electr@@ on@@ ics and they &apos;re now the they &apos;ve now managed to make it ri@@ pe for the market and are currently the the che@@ ap@@ est provi@@ ders of these devices worldwide .
970 H= they &apos;ve put so two bu@@ sters ran@@ ked so two two industri@@ alists and said , o@@ .@@ k , making we make easier and che@@ che@@ aper , and then source source source source resources , electr@@ on@@ ics stuff assem@@ bled together , integr@@ ating electr@@ on@@ ics things built together and are now the fact that have brought this device together and are now the che@@ ap@@ est bend fle@@ xes from these sound tools worldwide .
970 G= and they have set up two so two hand@@ y@@ men and said , ok , we make it easier and che@@ aper , and then just from open source , so free@@ ly available hard@@ ware , electro@@ ni@@ cs , this device <<unk>> and are now even have that brought to market and are now the che@@ ap@@ est supp@@ lie@@ r of these devices worldwide .
5640 T= because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jum@@ ps in technology that seem so fast that we can bar@@ ely keep on top of it .
5640 H= usually my role in expla@@ ining to people people like mira@@ gor@@ ous technologies that arri@@ ves at the arri@@ ve , and what i thought , because i &apos;m under friends here i am here under friends here , i would tell you what i truly think . and also try to look back and understand what here really is about , with those incredible jump ahead , that we can bar@@ ely keep alone alone .

2702 T= and so , that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ or@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
2702 H= and that would be your response to the stock market g@@ om@@ g says that whenever you use all of solving all of solving energy around solving co2 to solving co2 that suffering the other goals bene@@ ath the other goals suffering that reduce awareness of malaria and so forth that there &apos;s a stupid waste waste of resources and so forth that there &apos;s a stupid waste waste of resource resources spending money we can do .

74 T= it means that a young kid from the and@@ es who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her dest@@ in@@ y will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mon@@ tan@@ a raised to believe that a mountain is a pi@@ le of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
74 H= what it means is that a little child becomes grown from the evidence belie@@ ves believe that the mountain is a ash@@ a spirit spirit that determin@@ ed a ash@@ a spirit that determin@@ es your dest@@ in@@ y becomes another person becoming another person , and another relationship becoming that resource or that place , as a small child grew out of mon@@ tan@@ a belie@@ ving in belie@@ fs that a mountain is a pi@@ le st@@ st@@ st@@ ones that can be st@@ ressed .
