<br><br>3292 T= but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .

<br><br>5417 T= so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
<br>5417 0.32831 G= so we <b>just</b> <b>li@@</b> sts our brains , because our <b>brains</b> <b>don</b> <b>&apos;t</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>.</b> 
<br>5417 0.33536 H= and so we over@@ bul@@ let our brains , because the brain doesn &apos;t really make sense that it does not really make sense .

<br>5449 0.17317 H= and i think , most importantly , the most important thing is that we &apos;ve heard , talking to our patients with our patients .
<br><br>5470 T= make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embra@@ ce patients in the team .
<br>5470 0.44933 G= <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>metho@@</b> <b>ds</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>embra@@</b> <b>ce</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>.</b>

<br><br>4843 T= and this is one of these images that we cap@@ tured in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
<br>4843 0.20665 G= <b>this</b> is one of <b>the</b> images that we <b>&apos;ve</b> <b>been</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-@@</b> <b>called</b> gi@@ g@@ ap@@ <b>ian</b> <b>technology</b> . 
<br>4843 0.21083 H= this is one of the images that we have noticed with what &apos;s called the gre@@ g@@ ap@@ el technology . &quot;
<br><br>2825 T= unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
<br>2825 0.21343 G= unfortunately , <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> good news <b>,</b> because there <b>&apos;s</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of other problems , and they <b>were</b> <b>often</b> mentioned <b>.</b> 
<br>2825 0.35694 H= sa@@ dly , that &apos;s already all the good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and they talked common frequ@@ ently .
<br><br>4530 T= here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ cked my so@@ cks off .
<br>4530 0.14611 G= here &apos;s <b>something</b> <b>really</b> cool stuff that we <b>&apos;ve</b> <b>discovered</b> -- <b>has</b> really <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the so@@ <b>ck</b> <b>.</b> 
<br>4530 0.10332 H= and this is something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- has really been stru@@ ck me out of the so@@ ak wal@@ ks . &quot;
<br><br>4536 T= the idea here is obviously not only to fo@@ ol the oper@@ ators in the control room .
<br>4536 0.45308 G= the idea <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is obviously not only <b>,</b> <b>the</b> <b>machin@@</b> ery oper@@ ators in the control room . 
<br>4536 0.19835 H= obviously , the idea of this is obviously not just the mechan@@ ical service service over the control room .
<br><br>4263 T= my heart beat fast , my head was di@@ zz@@ y , trying to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end what it was that stood in front of me .
<br>4263 0.0 G= my heart <b>box</b> <b>,</b> <b>i</b> <b>was</b> <b>s@@</b> <b>win@@</b> <b>deli@@</b> <b>ous</b> , <b>while</b> <b>i</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> what <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>before</b> <b>me</b> <b>.</b> 
<br>4263 0.0 H= my heart dest , i was che@@ ap@@ che@@ w , while i was trying to grab what was stood before .
<br><br>4365 T= so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
<br>4365 0.18557 G= so basically <b>,</b> <b>i</b> <b>&apos;m</b> <b>about</b> <b>,</b> if you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> something that &apos;s <b>impossible</b> <b>,</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>.</b> 
<br>4365 0.15821 H= so basically , i mean , if you look something l@@ n , it &apos;s impossible , then make it possible .
<br><br>4447 T= and that sa@@ dness really fra@@ med in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing .
<br>4447 0.22068 G= and <b>this</b> sa@@ dness really <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> thought , which is <b>that</b> i only wish <b>i</b> <b>wish</b> <b>i</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>.</b>
